       "\"In this chapter we are going to discuss the application of quantum\\nmechanics to a practical device, the ammonia maser. You may wonder why\\nwe stop our formal development of quantum mechanics to do a special\\nproblem, but you will find that many of the features of this special\\nproblem are quite common in the general theory of quantum mechanics,\\nand you will learn a great deal by considering this one problem in\\ndetail. The ammonia maser is a device for generating electromagnetic\\nwaves, whose operation is based on the properties of the ammonia\\nmolecule which we discussed briefly in the last chapter. We begin by\\nsummarizing what we found there.\\n\\nThe ammonia molecule has many states, but we are considering it as a\\ntwo-state system, thinking now only about what happens when the\\nmolecule is in any specific state of rotation or translation. A\\nphysical model for the two states can be visualized as follows. If the\\nammonia molecule is considered to be rotating about an axis passing\\nthrough the nitrogen atom and perpendicular to the plane of the\\nhydrogen atoms, as shown in Fig.Â\\xa09â\\x80\\x931, there are still\\ntwo possible conditionsâ\\x80\\x94the nitrogen may be on one side of the plane\\nof hydrogen atoms or on the other. We call these two states\\n$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$. They are taken as a set of base\\nstates for our analysis of the behavior of the ammonia molecule.\\n\\nIn a system with two base states, any stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\psi}$ of the system\\ncan always be described as a linear combination of the two base\\nstates; that is, there is a certain amplitudeÂ\\xa0$C_1$ to be in one base\\nstate and an amplitudeÂ\\xa0$C_2$ to be in the other. We can write its\\nstate vector as\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:1}\\n\\\\ket{\\\\psi}=\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}C_1+\\n\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}C_2,\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nwhere\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC_1=\\\\braket{\\\\slOne}{\\\\psi}\\\\quad\\n\\\\text{and}\\\\quad\\nC_2=\\\\braket{\\\\slTwo}{\\\\psi}.\\\\notag\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThese two amplitudes change with time according to the Hamiltonian equations,\\nEq.Â\\xa0(8.43). Making use of the symmetry of the two states of the\\nammonia molecule, we set $H_{11}=H_{22}=E_0$,\\nandÂ\\xa0$H_{12}=H_{21}=-A$, and get the solution [see Eqs.\\n(8.50) andÂ\\xa0(8.51)]\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:2}\\nC_1&=\\\\frac{a}{2}\\\\,e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)(E_0-A)t}+\\n\\\\frac{b}{2}\\\\,e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)(E_0+A)t},\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:3}\\nC_2&=\\\\frac{a}{2}\\\\,e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)(E_0-A)t}-\\n\\\\frac{b}{2}\\\\,e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)(E_0+A)t}.\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\nWe want now to take a closer look at these general solutions. Suppose\\nthat the molecule was initially put into a stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slII}}$\\nfor which the coefficientÂ\\xa0$b$ was equal to zero. Then atÂ\\xa0$t=0$ the\\namplitudes to be in the states $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$ are\\nidentical, and they stay that way for all time. Their phases\\nboth vary with time in the same wayâ\\x80\\x94with the\\nfrequencyÂ\\xa0$(E_0-A)/\\\\hbar$. Similarly, if we were to put the molecule into a\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}}$ for whichÂ\\xa0$a=0$, the amplitudeÂ\\xa0$C_2$ is\\nthe negative ofÂ\\xa0$C_1$, and this relationship would stay that\\nway forever. Both amplitudes would now vary with time with the\\nfrequencyÂ\\xa0$(E_0+A)/\\\\hbar$. These are the only two possibilities of\\nstates for which the relation between $C_1$ andÂ\\xa0$C_2$ is independent\\nof time.\\n\\nWe have found two special solutions in which the two amplitudes\\ndo not vary in magnitude and, furthermore, have phases which\\nvary at the same frequencies. These are stationary states as we\\ndefined them in SectionÂ\\xa07â\\x80\\x931, which means that they are\\nstates of definite energy. The stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slII}}$ has\\nthe energyÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slII}=E_0-A$, and the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}}$ has\\nthe energyÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slI}=E_0+A$. They are the only two stationary states\\nthat exist, so we find that the molecule has two energy levels, with\\nthe energy differenceÂ\\xa0$2A$. (We mean, of course, two energy levels for\\nthe assumed state of rotation and vibration which we referred to in\\nour initial assumptions.)1\\n\\nIf we hadnâ\\x80\\x99t allowed for the possibility of the nitrogen flipping back\\nand forth, we would have takenÂ\\xa0$A$ equal to zero and the two energy\\nlevels would be on top of each other at energyÂ\\xa0$E_0$. The actual\\nlevels are not this way; their average energy isÂ\\xa0$E_0$, but\\nthey are split apart byÂ\\xa0$\\\\pm A$, giving a separation of $2A$ between\\nthe energies of the two states. Since $A$ is, in fact, very small, the\\ndifference in energy is also very small.\\n\\nIn order to excite an electron inside an atom, the energies\\ninvolved are relatively very highâ\\x80\\x94requiring photons in the optical\\nor ultraviolet range. To excite the vibrations of the molecules\\ninvolves photons in the infrared. If you talk about exciting\\nrotations, the energy differences of the states correspond to\\nphotons in the far infrared. But the energy differenceÂ\\xa0$2A$ is lower\\nthan any of those and is, in fact, below the infrared and well into\\nthe microwave region. Experimentally, it has been found that there is\\na pair of energy levels with a separation of $10^{-4}$Â\\xa0electron\\nvoltâ\\x80\\x94corresponding to a frequency $24{,}000$Â\\xa0megacycles. Evidently\\nthis means thatÂ\\xa0$2A=hf$, with $f=24{,}000$Â\\xa0megacycles (corresponding\\nto a wavelength of $1\\\\tfrac{1}{4}$Â\\xa0cm). So here we have a molecule\\nthat has a transition which does not emit light in the ordinary sense,\\nbut emits microwaves.\\n\\nFor the work that follows we need to describe these two states of\\ndefinite energy a little bit better. Suppose we were to construct an\\namplitudeÂ\\xa0$C_{\\\\slII}$ by taking the sum of the two numbers $C_1$\\nandÂ\\xa0$C_2$:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:4}\\nC_{\\\\slII}=C_1+C_2=\\\\braket{\\\\slOne}{\\\\Phi}+\\\\braket{\\\\slTwo}{\\\\Phi}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nWhat would that mean? Well, this is just the amplitude to find the\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\Phi}$ in a new stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ in which the\\namplitudes of the original base states are equal. That is,\\nwritingÂ\\xa0$C_{\\\\slII}=\\\\braket{\\\\slII}{\\\\Phi}$, we can abstract\\ntheÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\Phi}$\\naway from Eq.Â\\xa0(9.4)â\\x80\\x94because it is true for anyÂ\\xa0$\\\\Phi$â\\x80\\x94and get\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\bra{\\\\slII}=\\\\bra{\\\\slOne}+\\\\bra{\\\\slTwo},\\\\notag\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nwhich means the same as\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:5}\\n\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}=\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}+\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe amplitude for the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ to be in the state\\n$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ is\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\braketsl{\\\\slOne}{\\\\slII}=\\\\braketsl{\\\\slOne}{\\\\slOne}+\\n\\\\braketsl{\\\\slOne}{\\\\slTwo},\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nwhich is, of course, justÂ\\xa0$1$, since $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$\\nare base states. The amplitude for the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ to be in\\nthe stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$ is alsoÂ\\xa0$1$, so the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ is\\none which has equal amplitudes to be in the two base states\\n$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$.\\n\\nWe are, however, in a bit of trouble. The stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ has a\\ntotal probability greater than one of being in some base state\\nor other. That simply means, however, that the state vector is\\nnot properly â\\x80\\x9cnormalized.â\\x80\\x9d We can take care of that by remembering\\nthat we should haveÂ\\xa0$\\\\braketsl{\\\\slII}{\\\\slII}=1$, which must be so for\\nany state. Using the general relation that\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\braket{\\\\chi}{\\\\Phi}=\\\\sum_i\\\\braket{\\\\chi}{i}\\\\braket{i}{\\\\Phi},\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nletting both $\\\\Phi$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\chi$ be the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\slII$, and taking the\\nsum over the base states $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$, we get\\nthat\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\braketsl{\\\\slII}{\\\\slII}=\\\\braketsl{\\\\slII}{\\\\slOne}\\\\braketsl{\\\\slOne}{\\\\slII}+\\n\\\\braketsl{\\\\slII}{\\\\slTwo}\\\\braketsl{\\\\slTwo}{\\\\slII}.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThis will be equal to one as it should if we change our definition\\nofÂ\\xa0$C_{\\\\slII}$â\\x80\\x94in Eq.Â\\xa0(9.4)â\\x80\\x94to read\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\nC_{\\\\slII}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\,[C_1+C_2].\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nIn the same way we can construct an amplitude\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\nC_{\\\\slI}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\,[C_1-C_2],\\\\notag\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:6}\\nC_{\\\\slI}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\,[\\\\braket{\\\\slOne}{\\\\Phi}-\\\\braket{\\\\slTwo}{\\\\Phi}].\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThis amplitude is the projection of the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\Phi}$ into a new\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ which has opposite amplitudes to be in the states\\n$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$. Namely, Eq.Â\\xa0(9.6)\\nmeans the same as\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\bra{\\\\slI}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\,[\\\\bra{\\\\slOne}-\\\\bra{\\\\slTwo}],\\\\notag\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:7}\\n\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\,[\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}-\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}],\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nfrom which it follows that\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\braketsl{\\\\slOne}{\\\\slI}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}=-\\\\braketsl{\\\\slTwo}{\\\\slI}.\\\\notag\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nNow the reason we have done all this is that the states $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$\\nandÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ can be taken as a new set of base states\\nwhich are especially convenient for describing the stationary states\\nof the ammonia molecule. You remember that the requirement for a set\\nof base states is that\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\braket{i}{j}=\\\\delta_{ij}.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nWe have already fixed things so that\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\braketsl{\\\\slI}{\\\\slI}=\\\\braketsl{\\\\slII}{\\\\slII}=1.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nYou can easily show from Eqs. (9.5) andÂ\\xa0(9.7)\\nthat\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\braketsl{\\\\slI}{\\\\slII}=\\\\braketsl{\\\\slII}{\\\\slI}=0.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThe amplitudes $C_{\\\\slI}=\\\\braket{\\\\slI}{\\\\Phi}$\\nandÂ\\xa0$C_{\\\\slII}=\\\\braket{\\\\slII}{\\\\Phi}$ for any stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\Phi$ to be in our new\\nbase states $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ must also satisfy a\\nHamiltonian equation with the form of Eq.Â\\xa0(8.39). In\\nfact, if we just subtract the two equations (9.2)\\nandÂ\\xa0(9.3) and differentiate with respect toÂ\\xa0$t$, we see\\nthat\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:8}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{C_{\\\\slI}}{t}=(E_0+A)C_{\\\\slI}=E_{\\\\slI}C_{\\\\slI}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nAnd taking the sum of Eqs. (9.2) andÂ\\xa0(9.3), we\\nsee that\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:9}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{C_{\\\\slII}}{t}=(E_0-A)C_{\\\\slII}=E_{\\\\slII}C_{\\\\slII}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nUsing $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ for base states, the Hamiltonian\\nmatrix has the simple form\\n\\\\begin{alignat*}{2}\\nH_{\\\\slI,\\\\slI}&=E_{\\\\slI},&\\\\quad\\nH_{\\\\slI,\\\\slII}&=0,\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\nH_{\\\\slII,\\\\slI}&=0,&\\\\quad\\nH_{\\\\slII,\\\\slII}&=E_{\\\\slII}.\\n\\\\end{alignat*}\\n\\nNote that each of the Eqs. (9.8) andÂ\\xa0(9.9) look\\njust like what we had in SectionÂ\\xa08â\\x80\\x936 for the equation of a\\none-state system. They have a simple exponential time dependence corresponding\\nto a single energy. As time goes on, the amplitudes to be in each state act\\nindependently.\\n\\nThe two stationary states $\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slII}}$ we found\\nabove are, of course, solutions of Eqs. (9.8)\\nandÂ\\xa0(9.9). The stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}}$ (for whichÂ\\xa0$C_1=-C_2$) has\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:10}\\nC_{\\\\slI}=e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)(E_0+A)t},\\\\quad\\nC_{\\\\slII}=0.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nAnd the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slII}}$ (for whichÂ\\xa0$C_1=C_2$) has\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:11}\\nC_{\\\\slI}=0,\\\\quad\\nC_{\\\\slII}=e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)(E_0-A)t}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nRemember that the amplitudes in Eq.Â\\xa0(9.10) are\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\nC_{\\\\slI}=\\\\braket{\\\\slI}{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}},\\\\quad\\n\\\\text{and}\\\\quad\\nC_{\\\\slII}=\\\\braket{\\\\slII}{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}};\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nso Eq.Â\\xa0(9.10) means the same thing as\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}}=\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}\\\\,e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)(E_0+A)t}.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThat is, the state vector of the stationary stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}}$\\nis the same as the state vector of the base stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ except\\nfor the exponential factor appropriate to the energy of the state. In\\nfact atÂ\\xa0$t=0$\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}}=\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI};\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nthe stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ has the same physical configuration as the\\nstationary state of energyÂ\\xa0$E_0+A$. In the same way, we have for the\\nsecond stationary state that\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slII}}=\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}\\\\,e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)(E_0-A)t}.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThe stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ is just the stationary state of energyÂ\\xa0$E_0-A$\\natÂ\\xa0$t=0$. Thus our two new base states $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$\\nhave physically the form of the states of definite energy, with the\\nexponential time factor taken out so that they can be time-independent\\nbase states. (In what follows we will find it convenient not to have\\nto distinguish always between the stationary states\\n$\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slII}}$ and their base states\\n$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$, since they differ only by the obvious\\ntime factors.)\\n\\nIn summary, the state vectors $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ are a\\npair of base vectors which are appropriate for describing the definite\\nenergy states of the ammonia molecule. They are related to our\\noriginal base vectors by\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:12}\\n\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\,[\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}-\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}],\\\\quad\\n\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\,[\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}+\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}].\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe amplitudes to be in $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ are related to\\n$C_1$ andÂ\\xa0$C_2$ by\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:13}\\nC_{\\\\slI}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\,[C_1-C_2],\\\\quad\\nC_{\\\\slII}=\\\\frac{1}{\\\\sqrt{2}}\\\\,[C_1+C_2].\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nAny state at all can be represented by a linear combination of\\n$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$â\\x80\\x94with the coefficients $C_1$\\nandÂ\\xa0$C_2$â\\x80\\x94or by a linear combination of the definite energy base states\\n$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$â\\x80\\x94with the coefficients $C_{\\\\slI}$\\nandÂ\\xa0$C_{\\\\slII}$. Thus,\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\ket{\\\\Phi} =\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}C_1+\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}C_2\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nor\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\;\\\\ket{\\\\Phi} =\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}C_{\\\\slI}\\\\,+\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}C_{\\\\slII}.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThe second form gives us the amplitudes for finding the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ket{\\\\Phi}$\\nin a state with the energyÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slI}=E_0+A$ or in a state\\nwith the energyÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slII}=E_0-A$.\\n\\nIf the ammonia molecule is in either of the two states of definite\\nenergy and we disturb it at a frequencyÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega$ such\\nthatÂ\\xa0$\\\\hbar\\\\omega=$ $E_{\\\\slI}-E_{\\\\slII}=$ $2A$, the system may make a transition\\nfrom one state to the other. Or, if it is in the upper state, it may\\nchange to the lower state and emit a photon. But in order to induce\\nsuch transitions you must have a physical connection to the\\nstatesâ\\x80\\x94some way of disturbing the system. There must be some\\nexternal machinery for affecting the states, such as magnetic or\\nelectric fields. In this particular case, these states are sensitive\\nto an electric field. We will, therefore, look next at the problem of\\nthe behavior of the ammonia molecule in an external electric field.\\n\\nTo discuss the behavior in an electric field, we will go back to the\\noriginal base system $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$, rather than\\nusing $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$. Suppose that there is an\\nelectric field in a direction perpendicular to the plane of the\\nhydrogen atoms. Disregarding for the moment the possibility of\\nflipping back and forth, would it be true that the energy of this\\nmolecule is the same for the two positions of the nitrogen atom?\\nGenerally, no. The electrons tend to lie closer to the nitrogen than\\nto the hydrogen nuclei, so the hydrogens are slightly positive. The\\nactual amount depends on the details of electron distribution. It is a\\ncomplicated problem to figure out exactly what this distribution is,\\nbut in any case the net result is that the ammonia molecule has an\\nelectric dipole moment, as indicated in Fig.Â\\xa09â\\x80\\x931. We can\\ncontinue our analysis without knowing in detail the direction or amount\\nof displacement of the charge. However, to be consistent with the\\nnotation of others, letâ\\x80\\x99s suppose that the electric dipole moment\\nisÂ\\xa0$\\\\FLPmu$, with its direction pointing from the nitrogen atom and\\nperpendicular to the plane of the hydrogen atoms.\\n\\nNow, when the nitrogen flips from one side to the other, the center of\\nmass will not move, but the electric dipole moment will flip over. As\\na result of this moment, the energy in an electric fieldÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efieldvec$\\nwill depend on the molecular orientation.2 With the assumption made above,\\nthe potential energy will be higher if the nitrogen atom points in the\\ndirection of the field, and lower if it is in the opposite direction;\\nthe separation in the two energies will beÂ\\xa0$2\\\\mu\\\\Efield$.\\n\\nIn the discussion up to this point, we have assumed values of $E_0$\\nandÂ\\xa0$A$ without knowing how to calculate them. According to the\\ncorrect physical theory, it should be possible to calculate these\\nconstants in terms of the positions and motions of all the nuclei and\\nelectrons. But nobody has ever done it. Such a system involves ten\\nelectrons and four nuclei and thatâ\\x80\\x99s just too complicated a\\nproblem. As a matter of fact, there is no one who knows much more\\nabout this molecule than we do. All anyone can say is that when there\\nis an electric field, the energy of the two states is different, the\\ndifference being proportional to the electric field. We have called\\nthe coefficient of proportionalityÂ\\xa0$2\\\\mu$, but its value must be\\ndetermined experimentally. We can also say that the molecule has the\\namplitudeÂ\\xa0$A$ to flip over, but this will have to be measured\\nexperimentally. Nobody can give us accurate theoretical values of\\n$\\\\mu$ andÂ\\xa0$A$, because the calculations are too complicated to do in\\ndetail.\\n\\nFor the ammonia molecule in an electric field, our description must be\\nchanged. If we ignored the amplitude for the molecule to flip from one\\nconfiguration to the other, we would expect the energies of the two\\nstates $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$ to beÂ\\xa0$(E_0\\\\pm\\\\mu\\\\Efield)$.\\nFollowing the procedure of the last chapter, we\\ntake\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:14}\\nH_{11}=E_0+\\\\mu\\\\Efield,\\\\quad\\nH_{22}=E_0-\\\\mu\\\\Efield.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nAlso we will assume that for the electric fields of interest the field\\ndoes not affect appreciably the geometry of the molecule and,\\ntherefore, does not affect the amplitude that the nitrogen will jump\\nfrom one position to the other. We can then take that $H_{12}$\\nandÂ\\xa0$H_{21}$ are not changed; so\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:15}\\nH_{12}=H_{21}=-A.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nWe must now solve the Hamiltonian equations, Eq.Â\\xa0(8.43),\\nwith these new values ofÂ\\xa0$H_{ij}$. We could solve them just as we did\\nbefore, but since we are going to have several occasions to want the\\nsolutions for two-state systems, letâ\\x80\\x99s solve the equations once and for\\nall in the general case of arbitraryÂ\\xa0$H_{ij}$â\\x80\\x94assuming only that they\\ndo not change with time.\\n\\nWe want the general solution of the pair of Hamiltonian equations\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:16}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{C_1}{t}&=H_{11}C_1+H_{12}C_2,\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:17}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{C_2}{t}&=H_{21}C_1+H_{22}C_2.\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\nSince these are linear differential equations with constant\\ncoefficients, we can always find solutions which are exponential\\nfunctions of the dependent variableÂ\\xa0$t$. We will first look for a\\nsolution in which $C_1$ andÂ\\xa0$C_2$ both have the same time dependence;\\nwe can use the trial functions\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\nC_1=a_1e^{-i\\\\omega t},\\\\quad\\nC_2=a_2e^{-i\\\\omega t}.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nSince such a solution corresponds to a state of\\nenergyÂ\\xa0$E=\\\\hbar\\\\omega$, we may as well write right away\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:18}\\nC_1&=a_1e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)Et},\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:19}\\nC_2&=a_2e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)Et},\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\nwhere $E$ is as yet unknown and to be determined so that the\\ndifferential equations (9.16) andÂ\\xa0(9.17) are\\nsatisfied.\\n\\nWhen we substitute $C_1$ andÂ\\xa0$C_2$ from (9.18)\\nandÂ\\xa0(9.19) in the differential equations\\n(9.16) andÂ\\xa0(9.17), the derivatives give us\\njust $-iE/\\\\hbar$ times $C_1$ orÂ\\xa0$C_2$, so the left sides become just\\n$EC_1$ andÂ\\xa0$EC_2$. Cancelling the common exponential factors, we get\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\nEa_1=H_{11}a_1+H_{12}a_2,\\\\quad\\nEa_2=H_{21}a_1+H_{22}a_2.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nOr, rearranging the terms, we have\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:20}\\n(E-H_{11})a_1-H_{12}a_2&=0,\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:21}\\n-H_{21}a_1+(E-H_{22})a_2&=0.\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\nWith such a set of homogeneous algebraic equations, there will be\\nnonzero solutions for $a_1$ andÂ\\xa0$a_2$ only if the determinant of the\\ncoefficients of $a_1$ andÂ\\xa0$a_2$ is zero, that is, if\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:22}\\n\\\\Det\\\\begin{pmatrix}\\nE-H_{11} & \\\\phantom{E}-H_{12}\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\n\\\\phantom{E}-H_{21} & E-H_{22}\\n\\\\end{pmatrix}=0.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nHowever, when there are only two equations and two unknowns, we donâ\\x80\\x99t\\nneed such a sophisticated idea. The two equations (9.20)\\nandÂ\\xa0(9.21) each give a ratio for the two coefficients\\n$a_1$ andÂ\\xa0$a_2$, and these two ratios must be equal.\\nFromÂ\\xa0(9.20) we have that\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:23}\\n\\\\frac{a_1}{a_2} =\\\\frac{H_{12}}{E-H_{11}},\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nand fromÂ\\xa0(9.21) that\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:24}\\n\\\\frac{a_1}{a_2} =\\\\frac{E-H_{22}}{H_{21}}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nEquating these two ratios, we get that $E$ must satisfy\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n(E-H_{11})(E-H_{22})-H_{12}H_{21}=0.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThis is the same result we would get by solving Eq.Â\\xa0(9.22).\\nEither way, we have a quadratic equation forÂ\\xa0$E$ which has two\\nsolutions:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:25}\\nE=\\\\!\\\\frac{H_{11}\\\\!+\\\\!H_{22}}{2}\\\\!\\\\pm\\\\!\\n\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(H_{11}\\\\!-\\\\!H_{22})^2}{4}\\\\!+\\\\!H_{12}H_{21}}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThere are two possible values for the energyÂ\\xa0$E$. Note that both\\nsolutions give real numbers for the energy, because $H_{11}$\\nandÂ\\xa0$H_{22}$ are real, and $H_{12}H_{21}$ is equal\\ntoÂ\\xa0$H_{12}H_{12}\\\\cconj=\\\\abs{H_{12}}^2$, which is both real and positive.\\n\\nUsing the same convention we took before, we will call the upper\\nenergyÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slI}$ and the lower energyÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slII}$. We have\\n\\\\begin{align}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:26}\\nE_{\\\\slI}&=\\\\!\\\\frac{H_{11}\\\\!+\\\\!H_{22}}{2}\\\\!+\\\\!\\n\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(H_{11}\\\\!-\\\\!H_{22})^2}{4}\\\\!+\\\\!H_{12}H_{21}},\\\\\\\\[1.5ex]\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:27}\\nE_{\\\\slII}&=\\\\!\\\\frac{H_{11}\\\\!+\\\\!H_{22}}{2}\\\\!-\\\\!\\n\\\\sqrt{\\\\frac{(H_{11}\\\\!-\\\\!H_{22})^2}{4}\\\\!+\\\\!H_{12}H_{21}}.\\n\\\\end{align}\\n\\nUsing each of these two energies separately in Eqs. (9.18)\\nandÂ\\xa0(9.19), we have the amplitudes for the two stationary states\\n(the states of definite energy). If there are no external disturbances, a system\\ninitially in one of these states will stay that way foreverâ\\x80\\x94only its phase\\nchanges.\\n\\nWe can check our results for two special cases. If $H_{12}=H_{21}=0$, we have\\nthat $E_{\\\\slI}=H_{11}$ andÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slII}=H_{22}$. This is certainly correct,\\nbecause then Eqs. (9.16) andÂ\\xa0(9.17) are\\nuncoupled, and each represents a state of energy $H_{11}$ andÂ\\xa0$H_{22}$. Next, if\\nwe set $H_{11}=H_{22}=E_0$ andÂ\\xa0$H_{21}=H_{12}=-A$, we get the solution we found\\nbefore:\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\nE_{\\\\slI}=E_0+A\\\\quad\\n\\\\text{and}\\\\quad\\nE_{\\\\slII}=E_0-A.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nFor the general case, the two solutions $E_{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slII}$ refer to two\\nstatesâ\\x80\\x94which we can again call the states\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slI}}=\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slI}t}\\\\quad\\n\\\\text{and}\\\\quad\\n\\\\ket{\\\\psi_{\\\\slII}}=\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slII}t}.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThese states will have $C_1$ andÂ\\xa0$C_2$ as given in Eqs.\\n(9.18) andÂ\\xa0(9.19), where $a_1$ andÂ\\xa0$a_2$ are still to\\nbe determined. Their ratio is given by either Eq.Â\\xa0(9.23) or\\nEq.Â\\xa0(9.24). They must also satisfy one more condition. If the\\nsystem is known to be in one of the stationary states, the sum of the\\nprobabilities that it will be found in $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slOne}$ orÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slTwo}$ must\\nequal one. We must have that\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:28}\\n\\\\abs{C_1}^2+\\\\abs{C_2}^2=1,\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nor, equivalently,\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:29}\\n\\\\abs{a_1}^2+\\\\abs{a_2}^2=1.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThese conditions do not uniquely specify $a_1$ andÂ\\xa0$a_2$; they are\\nstill undetermined by an arbitrary phaseâ\\x80\\x94in other words, by a factor\\nlikeÂ\\xa0$e^{i\\\\delta}$. Although general solutions for theÂ\\xa0$a$â\\x80\\x99s can be\\nwritten down,3 it is usually more convenient to work them out for each special\\ncase.\\n\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s go back now to our particular example of the ammonia molecule in\\nan electric field. Using the values for $H_{11}$,Â\\xa0$H_{22}$,\\nandÂ\\xa0$H_{12}$ given in (9.14) andÂ\\xa0(9.15), we get\\nfor the energies of the two stationary states\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:30}\\nE_{\\\\slI}=E_0+\\\\sqrt{A^2+\\\\mu^2\\\\Efield^2},\\\\quad\\nE_{\\\\slII}=E_0-\\\\sqrt{A^2+\\\\mu^2\\\\Efield^2}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nE_{\\\\slI}&=E_0+\\\\sqrt{A^2+\\\\mu^2\\\\Efield^2},\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\nE_{\\\\slII}&=E_0-\\\\sqrt{A^2+\\\\mu^2\\\\Efield^2}.\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:30}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThese two energies are plotted as a function of the electric field\\nstrengthÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield$ in Fig.Â\\xa09â\\x80\\x932. When the electric field\\nis zero, the two energies are, of course, justÂ\\xa0$E_0\\\\pm A$. When an\\nelectric field is applied, the splitting between the two levels\\nincreases. The splitting increases at first slowly withÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield$, but\\neventually becomes proportional toÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield$. (The curve is a\\nhyperbola.) For enormously strong fields, the energies are just\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:31}\\nE_{\\\\slI}=E_0+\\\\mu\\\\Efield=H_{11},\\\\quad\\nE_{\\\\slII}=E_0-\\\\mu\\\\Efield=H_{22}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\nE_{\\\\slI}&=E_0+\\\\mu\\\\Efield=H_{11},\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\nE_{\\\\slII}&=E_0-\\\\mu\\\\Efield=H_{22}.\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:31}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\n\\nThe fact that there is an amplitude for the nitrogen to flip\\nback and forth has little effect when the two positions have very\\ndifferent energies. This is an interesting point which we will come\\nback to again later.\\n\\nWe are at last ready to understand the operation of the ammonia\\nmaser. The idea is the following. First, we find a way of separating\\nmolecules in the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ from those in the\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$.4 Then the\\nmolecules in the higher energy stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ are passed through a\\ncavity which has a resonant frequency of $24{,}000$Â\\xa0megacycles. The\\nmolecules can deliver energy to the cavityâ\\x80\\x94in a way we will discuss\\nlaterâ\\x80\\x94and leave the cavity in the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$. Each molecule\\nthat makes such a transition will deliver the\\nenergyÂ\\xa0$E=E_{\\\\slI}-E_{\\\\slII}$ to the cavity. The energy from the molecules\\nwill appear as electrical energy in the cavity.\\n\\nHow can we separate the two molecular states? One method is as\\nfollows. The ammonia gas is let out of a little jet and passed through\\na pair of slits to give a narrow beam, as shown in\\nFig.Â\\xa09â\\x80\\x933. The beam is then sent through a region in which\\nthere is a large transverse electric field. The electrodes to produce\\nthe field are shaped so that the electric field varies rapidly across\\nthe beam. Then the square of the electric\\nfieldÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efieldvec\\\\cdot\\\\Efieldvec$ will have a large gradient perpendicular to\\nthe beam. Now a molecule in stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ has an energy which\\nincreases withÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield^2$, and therefore this part of the beam will be\\ndeflected toward the region of lowerÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield^2$. A molecule in\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ will, on the other hand, be deflected toward the region of\\nlargerÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield^2$, since its energy decreases asÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield^2$ increases.\\n\\nIncidentally, with the electric fields which can be generated in the\\nlaboratory, the energyÂ\\xa0$\\\\mu\\\\Efield$ is always much smaller thanÂ\\xa0$A$.\\nIn such cases, the square root in Eqs.Â\\xa0(9.30) can\\nbe approximated by\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:32}\\nA\\\\biggl(\\n1+\\\\frac{1}{2}\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\mu^2\\\\Efield^2}{A^2}\\n\\\\biggr).\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nSo the energy levels are, for all practical purposes,\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:33}\\nE_{\\\\slI} =E_0+A+\\\\frac{\\\\mu^2\\\\Efield^2}{2A}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nand\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:34}\\nE_{\\\\slII} =E_0-A-\\\\frac{\\\\mu^2\\\\Efield^2}{2A}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nAnd the energies vary approximately linearly withÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield^2$. The\\nforce on the molecules is then\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:35}\\n\\\\FLPF=\\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{2A}\\\\,\\\\FLPgrad{\\\\Efield^2}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nMany molecules have an energy in an electric field which is\\nproportional toÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield^2$. The coefficient is the polarizability of\\nthe molecule. Ammonia has an unusually high polarizability because of\\nthe small value ofÂ\\xa0$A$ in the denominator. Thus, ammonia molecules are\\nunusually sensitive to an electric field. (What would you expect for\\nthe dielectric coefficient of NH$_3$ gas?)\\n\\nIn the ammonia maser, the beam with molecules in the\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ and with the energyÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slI}$ is sent through a resonant\\ncavity, as shown in Fig.Â\\xa09â\\x80\\x934. The other beam is\\ndiscarded. Inside the cavity, there will be a time-varying electric\\nfield, so the next problem we must discuss is the behavior of a molecule\\nin an electric field that varies with time. We have a completely\\ndifferent kind of a problemâ\\x80\\x94one with a time-varying Hamiltonian. Since\\n$H_{ij}$ depends uponÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield$, theÂ\\xa0$H_{ij}$ vary with time, and we\\nmust determine the behavior of the system in this circumstance.\\n\\nTo begin with, we write down the equations to be solved:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{C_1}{t}&=(E_0+\\\\mu\\\\Efield)C_1-AC_2,\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{C_2}{t}&=-AC_1+(E_0-\\\\mu\\\\Efield)C_2.\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:36}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nTo be definite, letâ\\x80\\x99s suppose that the electric field varies\\nsinusoidally; then we can write\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:37}\\n\\\\Efield=2\\\\Efield_0\\\\cos\\\\omega t=\\n\\\\Efield_0(e^{i\\\\omega t}+e^{-i\\\\omega t}).\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nIn actual operation the frequencyÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega$ will be very nearly equal\\nto the resonant frequency of the molecular\\ntransitionÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega_0=2A/\\\\hbar$, but for the time being we want to keep things\\ngeneral, so weâ\\x80\\x99ll let it have any value at all. The best way to solve\\nour equations is to form linear combinations of $C_1$ andÂ\\xa0$C_2$ as we\\ndid before. So we add the two equations, divide by the square root\\nofÂ\\xa0$2$, and use the definitions of $C_{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$C_{\\\\slII}$ that we had\\nin Eq.Â\\xa0(9.13). We get\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:38}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{C_{\\\\slII}}{t}=\\n(E_0-A)C_{\\\\slII}+\\\\mu\\\\Efield C_{\\\\slI}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nYouâ\\x80\\x99ll note that this is the same as Eq.Â\\xa0(9.9) with an\\nextra term due to the electric field. Similarly, if we subtract the\\ntwo equationsÂ\\xa0(9.36), we get\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:39}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{C_{\\\\slI}}{t}=\\n(E_0+A)C_{\\\\slI}+\\\\mu\\\\Efield C_{\\\\slII}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nNow the question is, how to solve these equations? They are more\\ndifficult than our earlier set, because $\\\\Efield$ depends onÂ\\xa0$t$; and,\\nin fact, for a generalÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield(t)$ the solution is not expressible in\\nelementary functions. However, we can get a good approximation so long\\nas the electric field is small. First we will write\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\begin{gathered}\\nC_{\\\\slI}=\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}e^{-i(E_0+A)t/\\\\hbar}=\\n\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}e^{-i(E_{\\\\slI})t/\\\\hbar},\\\\\\\\\\n\\\\\\\\\\nC_{\\\\slII}=\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}e^{-i(E_0-A)t/\\\\hbar}=\\n\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}e^{-i(E_{\\\\slII})t/\\\\hbar}.\\n\\\\end{gathered}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:40}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nIf there were no electric field, these solutions would be correct with\\n$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}$ just chosen as two complex\\nconstants. In fact, since the probability of being in\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ is the absolute square ofÂ\\xa0$C_{\\\\slI}$ and the probability\\nof being in stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ is the absolute square ofÂ\\xa0$C_{\\\\slII}$,\\nthe probability of being in stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ or in\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ is just $\\\\abs{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}}^2$\\norÂ\\xa0$\\\\abs{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}^2$. For instance, if the system were to start\\noriginally in stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ so that $\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$ was zero and\\n$\\\\abs{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}^2$ was one, this condition would go on\\nforever. There would be no chance, if the molecule were originally in\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$, ever to get into stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$.\\n\\nNow the idea of writing our equations in the form of\\nEq.Â\\xa0(9.40) is that if $\\\\mu\\\\Efield$ is small in comparison\\nwithÂ\\xa0$A$, the solutions can still be written in this way, but then\\n$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}$ become slowly varying functions of\\ntimeâ\\x80\\x94where by â\\x80\\x9cslowly varyingâ\\x80\\x9d we mean slowly in comparison\\nwith the exponential functions. That is the trick. We use the fact that\\n$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}$ vary slowly to get an approximate\\nsolution.\\n\\nWe want now to substitute $C_{\\\\slI}$ from Eq.Â\\xa0(9.40) in\\nthe differential equationÂ\\xa0(9.39), but we must remember\\nthat $\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$ is also a function ofÂ\\xa0$t$. We have\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{C_{\\\\slI}}{t}=\\nE_{\\\\slI}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}e^{-iE_{\\\\slI}t/\\\\hbar}+\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}}{t}\\\\,e^{-iE_{\\\\slI}t/\\\\hbar}.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\nThe differential equation becomes\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:41}\\n\\\\biggl(E_{\\\\slI}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}+i\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}}{t}\\\\biggr)\\ne^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slI}t}=\\nE_{\\\\slI}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slI}t}+\\n\\\\mu\\\\Efield\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slII}t}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\begin{gathered}\\n\\\\biggl(E_{\\\\slI}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}+i\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}}{t}\\\\biggr)\\ne^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slI}t}=\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\nE_{\\\\slI}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slI}t}+\\n\\\\mu\\\\Efield\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slII}t}.\\n\\\\end{gathered}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:41}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nSimilarly, the equation in $dC_{\\\\slII}/dt$ becomes\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:42}\\n\\\\biggl(E_{\\\\slII}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}+i\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}{t}\\\\biggr)\\ne^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slII}t}=\\nE_{\\\\slII}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slII}t}+\\n\\\\mu\\\\Efield\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slI}t}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\begin{gathered}\\n\\\\biggl(E_{\\\\slII}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}+i\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}{t}\\\\biggr)\\ne^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slII}t}=\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\nE_{\\\\slII}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slII}t}+\\n\\\\mu\\\\Efield\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}e^{-(i/\\\\hbar)E_{\\\\slI}t}.\\n\\\\end{gathered}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:42}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nNow you will notice that we have equal terms on both sides of each\\nequation. We cancel these terms, and we also multiply the first\\nequation byÂ\\xa0$e^{+iE_{\\\\slI}t/\\\\hbar}$ and the second\\nbyÂ\\xa0$e^{+iE_{\\\\slII}t/\\\\hbar}$. Remembering that\\n$(E_{\\\\slI}-E_{\\\\slII})=$ $2A=$ $\\\\hbar\\\\omega_0$, we have finally,\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:43}\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}}{t}&=\\n\\\\mu\\\\Efield(t)e^{i\\\\omega_0t}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII},\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}{t}&=\\n\\\\mu\\\\Efield(t)e^{-i\\\\omega_0t}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}.\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nNow we have an apparently simple pair of equationsâ\\x80\\x94and they are\\nstill exact, of course. The derivative of one variable is a function\\nof timeÂ\\xa0$\\\\mu\\\\Efield(t)e^{i\\\\omega_0t}$, multiplied by the second\\nvariable; the derivative of the second is a similar time function,\\nmultiplied by the first. Although these simple equations cannot be\\nsolved in general, we will solve them for some special cases.\\n\\nWe are, for the moment at least, interested only in the case of an\\noscillating electric field. Taking $\\\\Efield(t)$ as given in\\nEq.Â\\xa0(9.37), we find that the equations for $\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$\\nandÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}$ become\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:44}\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}}{t}&=\\n\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0[e^{i(\\\\omega+\\\\omega_0)t}+\\ne^{-i(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)t}]\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII},\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}{t}&=\\n\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0[e^{i(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)t}+\\ne^{-i(\\\\omega+\\\\omega_0)t}]\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}.\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nNow if $\\\\Efield_0$ is sufficiently small, the rates of change of\\n$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}$ are also small. The\\ntwoÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma$â\\x80\\x99s will not vary much withÂ\\xa0$t$, especially in comparison with\\nthe rapid variations due to the exponential terms. These exponential\\nterms have real and imaginary parts that oscillate at the frequency\\n$\\\\omega+\\\\omega_0$ orÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0$. The terms\\nwithÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega+\\\\omega_0$ oscillate very rapidly about an average value of\\nzero and, therefore, do not contribute very much on the average to the\\nrate of change ofÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma$. So we can make a reasonably good\\napproximation by replacing these terms by their average value, namely,\\nzero. We will just leave them out, and take as our approximation:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}}{t}&=\\n\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0e^{-i(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)t}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII},\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\ni\\\\hbar\\\\,\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}{t}&=\\n\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0e^{i(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)t}\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}.\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:45}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nEven the remaining terms, with exponents proportional\\ntoÂ\\xa0$(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)$, will also vary rapidly unless $\\\\omega$ is\\nnearÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega_0$. Only then will the right-hand side vary slowly enough that\\nany appreciable amount will accumulate when we integrate the equations\\nwith respect toÂ\\xa0$t$. In other words, with a weak electric field\\nthe only significant frequencies are those nearÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega_0$.\\n\\nWith the approximation made in getting Eq.Â\\xa0(9.45), the\\nequations can be solved exactly, but the work is a little elaborate,\\nso we wonâ\\x80\\x99t do that until later when we take up another problem of the\\nsame type. Now weâ\\x80\\x99ll just solve them approximatelyâ\\x80\\x94or rather, weâ\\x80\\x99ll\\nfind an exact solution for the case of perfect resonance,\\n$\\\\omega=\\\\omega_0$, and an approximate solution for frequencies near\\nresonance.\\n\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s take the case of perfect resonance first. If we take\\n$\\\\omega=\\\\omega_0$, the exponentials are equal to one in both equations\\nofÂ\\xa0(9.45), and we have just\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:46}\\n\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}}{t}=-\\\\frac{i\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0}{\\\\hbar}\\\\,\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII},\\\\quad\\n\\\\ddt{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}{t}=-\\\\frac{i\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0}{\\\\hbar}\\\\,\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nIf we eliminate first $\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$ and then $\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}$ from\\nthese equations, we find that each satisfies the differential equation\\nof simple harmonic motion:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:47}\\n\\\\frac{d^2\\\\gamma}{dt^2}=-\\\\biggl(\\n\\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0}{\\\\hbar}\\n\\\\biggr)^2\\\\gamma.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThe general solutions for these equations can be made up of sines and\\ncosines. As you can easily verify, the following equations are a\\nsolution:\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\begin{aligned}\\n\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}&=a\\\\cos\\\\biggl(\\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0}{\\\\hbar}\\\\biggr)t+\\nb\\\\sin\\\\biggl(\\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0}{\\\\hbar}\\\\biggr)t,\\\\\\\\[1.5ex]\\n\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}&=ib\\\\cos\\\\biggl(\\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0}{\\\\hbar}\\\\biggr)t-\\nia\\\\sin\\\\biggl(\\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0}{\\\\hbar}\\\\biggr)t,\\n\\\\end{aligned}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:48}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nwhere $a$ andÂ\\xa0$b$ are constants to be determined to fit any particular\\nphysical situation.\\n\\nFor instance, suppose that atÂ\\xa0$t=0$ our molecular system was in the\\nupper energy stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$, which would requireâ\\x80\\x94from\\nEq.Â\\xa0(9.40)â\\x80\\x94that $\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}=1$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}=0$\\natÂ\\xa0$t=0$. For this situation we would need $a=1$ andÂ\\xa0$b=0$. The\\nprobability that the molecule is in the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ at some\\nlaterÂ\\xa0$t$ is the absolute square ofÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$, or\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:49}\\nP_{\\\\slI}=\\\\abs{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}}^2=\\n\\\\cos^2\\\\biggl(\\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0}{\\\\hbar}\\\\biggr)t.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nSimilarly, the probability that the molecule will be in the\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ is given by the absolute square ofÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}$,\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:50}\\nP_{\\\\slII}=\\\\abs{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}^2=\\n\\\\sin^2\\\\biggl(\\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0}{\\\\hbar}\\\\biggr)t.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nSo long asÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield$ is small and we are on resonance, the\\nprobabilities are given by simple oscillating functions. The\\nprobability to be in stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ falls from one to zero and\\nback again, while the probability to be in the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$\\nrises from zero to one and back. The time variation of the two\\nprobabilities is shown in Fig.Â\\xa09â\\x80\\x935. Needless to say, the\\nsum of the two probabilities is always equal to one; the molecule is\\nalways in some state!\\n\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s suppose that it takes the molecule the timeÂ\\xa0$T$ to go through\\nthe cavity. If we make the cavity just long enough so\\nthatÂ\\xa0$\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0T/\\\\hbar=\\\\pi/2$, then a molecule which enters in\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ will certainly leave it in stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$. If it\\nenters the cavity in the upper state, it will leave the cavity in the\\nlower state. In other words, its energy is decreased, and the loss of\\nenergy canâ\\x80\\x99t go anywhere else but into the machinery which generates\\nthe field. The details by which you can see how the energy of the\\nmolecule is fed into the oscillations of the cavity are not simple;\\nhowever, we donâ\\x80\\x99t need to study these details, because we can use the\\nprinciple of conservation of energy. (We could study them if we had\\nto, but then we would have to deal with the quantum mechanics of the\\nfield in the cavity in addition to the quantum mechanics of the atom.)\\n\\nIn summary: the molecule enters the cavity, the cavity\\nfieldâ\\x80\\x94oscillating at exactly the right frequencyâ\\x80\\x94induces\\ntransitions from the upper to the lower state, and the energy released\\nis fed into the oscillating field. In an operating maser the molecules\\ndeliver enough energy to maintain the cavity oscillationsâ\\x80\\x94not only\\nproviding enough power to make up for the cavity losses but even\\nproviding small amounts of excess power that can be drawn from the\\ncavity. Thus, the molecular energy is converted into the energy of an\\nexternal electromagnetic field.\\n\\nRemember that before the beam enters the cavity, we have to use a\\nfilter which separates the beam so that only the upper state\\nenters. It is easy to demonstrate that if you were to start with\\nmolecules in the lower state, the process will go the other way and\\ntake energy out of the cavity. If you put the unfiltered beam in, as\\nmany molecules are taking energy out as are putting energy in, so\\nnothing much would happen. In actual operation it isnâ\\x80\\x99t necessary, of\\ncourse, to make $(\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0T/\\\\hbar)$ exactlyÂ\\xa0$\\\\pi/2$. For any other\\nvalue (except an exact integral multiple ofÂ\\xa0$\\\\pi$), there is some\\nprobability for transitions from stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ to\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$. For other values, however, the device isnâ\\x80\\x99t\\n$100$Â\\xa0percent efficient; many of the molecules which leave the cavity could\\nhave delivered some energy to the cavity but didnâ\\x80\\x99t.\\n\\nIn actual use, the velocity of all the molecules is not the same; they\\nhave some kind of Maxwell distribution. This means that the ideal\\nperiods of time for different molecules will be different, and it is\\nimpossible to get $100$Â\\xa0percent efficiency for all the molecules at\\nonce. In addition, there is another complication which is easy to take\\ninto account, but we donâ\\x80\\x99t want to bother with it at this stage. You\\nremember that the electric field in a cavity usually varies from place\\nto place across the cavity. Thus, as the molecules drift across the\\ncavity, the electric field at the molecule varies in a way that is\\nmore complicated than the simple sinusoidal oscillation in time that\\nwe have assumed. Clearly, one would have to use a more complicated\\nintegration to do the problem exactly, but the general idea is still\\nthe same.\\n\\nThere are other ways of making masers. Instead of separating the atoms\\nin stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ from those in stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ by a\\nStern-Gerlach apparatus, one can have the atoms already in the cavity\\n(as a gas or a solid) and shift atoms from stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ to\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ by some means. One way is one used in the so-called\\nthree-state maser. For it, atomic systems are used which have three\\nenergy levels, as shown in Fig.Â\\xa09â\\x80\\x936, with the following\\nspecial properties. The system will absorb radiation (say, light) of\\nfrequencyÂ\\xa0$\\\\hbar\\\\omega_1$ and go from the lowest energy\\nlevelÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slII}$, to some high-energy levelÂ\\xa0$E'$, and then will quickly emit\\nphotons of frequencyÂ\\xa0$\\\\hbar\\\\omega_2$ and go to the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$\\nwith energyÂ\\xa0$E_{\\\\slI}$. The stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ has a long lifetime so\\nits population can be raised, and the conditions are then appropriate\\nfor maser operation between states $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$.\\nAlthough such a device is called a â\\x80\\x9cthree-stateâ\\x80\\x9d maser, the maser\\noperation really works just as a two-state system such as we are\\ndescribing.\\n\\nA laser (Light Amplification by\\nStimulated Emission of Radiation) is just a maser\\nworking at optical frequencies. The â\\x80\\x9ccavityâ\\x80\\x9d for a laser usually\\nconsists of just two plane mirrors between which standing waves are\\ngenerated.\\n\\nFinally, we would like to find out how the states vary in the\\ncircumstance that the cavity frequency is nearly, but not exactly,\\nequal toÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega_0$. We could solve this problem exactly, but instead\\nof trying to do that, weâ\\x80\\x99ll take the important case that the electric\\nfield is small and also the period of timeÂ\\xa0$T$ is small, so\\nthatÂ\\xa0$\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0T/\\\\hbar$ is much less than one. Then, even in the case of\\nperfect resonance which we have just worked out, the probability of\\nmaking a transition is small. Suppose that we start again with\\n$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}=1$ andÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}=0$. During the timeÂ\\xa0$T$ we would\\nexpect $\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$ to remain nearly equal to one, and\\n$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}$ to remain very small compared with unity. Then the\\nproblem is very easy. We can calculateÂ\\xa0$\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}$ from the\\nsecond equation inÂ\\xa0(9.45), taking $\\\\gamma_{\\\\slI}$ equal\\nto one and integrating from $t=0$ toÂ\\xa0$t=T$. We get\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:51}\\n\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}=\\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0}{\\\\hbar}\\\\,\\\\biggl[\\n\\\\frac{1-e^{i(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T}}{\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0}\\n\\\\biggr].\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThis $\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}$, used with Eq.Â\\xa0(9.40), gives the\\namplitude to have made a transition from the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ to the\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ during the time intervalÂ\\xa0$T$. The\\nprobabilityÂ\\xa0$P(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)$ to make the transition\\nisÂ\\xa0$\\\\abs{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}^2$, or\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:52}\\nP(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)=\\\\abs{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}^2=\\n\\\\biggl[\\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0T}{\\\\hbar}\\\\biggr]^2\\n\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]}\\n{[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]^2}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{gather}\\nP(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)=\\\\abs{\\\\gamma_{\\\\slII}}^2\\\\notag\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:52}\\n=\\\\biggl[\\\\frac{\\\\mu\\\\Efield_0T}{\\\\hbar}\\\\biggr]^2\\n\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]}\\n{[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]^2}.\\n\\\\end{gather}\\n\\nIt is interesting to plot this probability for a fixed length of time\\nas a function of the frequency of the cavity in order to see how\\nsensitive it is to frequencies near the resonant frequencyÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega_0$.\\nWe show such a plot ofÂ\\xa0$P(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)$ in\\nFig.Â\\xa09â\\x80\\x937. (The vertical scale has been adjusted to beÂ\\xa0$1$\\nat the peak by dividing by the value of the probability\\nwhenÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega=\\\\omega_0$.) We have seen a curve like this in the diffraction\\ntheory, so you should already be familiar with it. The curve falls\\nrather abruptly to zero forÂ\\xa0$(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)=2\\\\pi/T$ and never regains\\nsignificant size for large frequency deviations. In fact, by far the\\ngreatest part of the area under the curve lies within the\\nrangeÂ\\xa0$\\\\pm\\\\pi/T$. It is possible to show5 that the area under the\\ncurve is justÂ\\xa0$2\\\\pi/T$ and is equal to the area of the shaded rectangle\\ndrawn in the figure.\\n\\nLetâ\\x80\\x99s examine the implication of our results for a real maser. Suppose\\nthat the ammonia molecule is in the cavity for a reasonable length of\\ntime, say for one millisecond. Then for $f_0=24{,}000$Â\\xa0megacycles, we\\ncan calculate that the probability for a transition falls to zero for\\na frequency deviation ofÂ\\xa0$(f-f_0)/f_0=1/f_0T$, which is five parts\\ninÂ\\xa0$10^8$. Evidently the frequency must be very close toÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega_0$ to\\nget a significant transition probability. Such an effect is the basis\\nof the great precision that can be obtained with â\\x80\\x9catomicâ\\x80\\x9d\\nclocks, which work on the maser principle.\\n\\nOur treatment above applies to a more general situation than the\\nammonia maser. We have treated the behavior of a molecule under the\\ninfluence of an electric field, whether that field was confined in a\\ncavity or not. So we could be simply shining a beam of â\\x80\\x9clightâ\\x80\\x9dâ\\x80\\x94at\\nmicrowave frequenciesâ\\x80\\x94at the molecule and ask for the probability of\\nemission or absorption. Our equations apply equally well to this case,\\nbut letâ\\x80\\x99s rewrite them in terms of the intensity of the\\nradiation rather than the electric field. If we define the\\nintensityÂ\\xa0$\\\\intensity$ to be the average energy flow per unit area per second,\\nthen from ChapterÂ\\xa027 of VolumeÂ\\xa0II, we can write\\n\\\\begin{equation*}\\n\\\\intensity=\\\\epsO c^2\\\\abs{\\\\Efieldvec\\\\times\\\\FLPB}_{\\\\text{ave}}=\\n\\\\tfrac{1}{2}\\\\epsO c^2\\\\abs{\\\\Efieldvec\\\\times\\\\FLPB}_{\\\\text{max}}=\\n2\\\\epsO c\\\\Efield_0^2.\\n\\\\end{equation*}\\n\\n(The maximum value ofÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield$ isÂ\\xa0$2\\\\Efield_0$.) The transition\\nprobability now becomes:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:53}\\nP(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)=2\\\\pi\\\\biggl[\\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsO\\\\hbar^2c}\\\\biggr]\\n\\\\intensity T^2\\\\,\\n\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]}\\n{[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]^2}.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{gather}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:53}\\nP(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)=\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\n2\\\\pi\\\\biggl[\\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsO\\\\hbar^2c}\\\\biggr]\\n\\\\intensity T^2\\\\,\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]}\\n{[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]^2}.\\\\notag\\n\\\\end{gather}\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nOrdinarily the light shining on such a system is not exactly\\nmonochromatic.  It is, therefore, interesting to solve one more\\nproblemâ\\x80\\x94that is, to calculate the transition probability when the\\nlight has intensityÂ\\xa0$\\\\intensity(\\\\omega)$ per unit frequency interval,\\ncovering a broad range which includesÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega_0$. Then, the\\nprobability of going from $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ toÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$ will become an\\nintegral:\\n\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:54}\\nP(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)=2\\\\pi\\\\biggl[\\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsO\\\\hbar^2c}\\\\biggr]T^2\\n\\\\int_0^\\\\infty\\\\intensity(\\\\omega)\\\\,\\n\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]}\\n{[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]^2}\\\\,d\\\\omega.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\n\\n\\\\begin{gather}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:54}\\nP(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)=\\\\\\\\[1ex]\\n2\\\\pi\\\\biggl[\\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsO\\\\hbar^2c}\\\\biggr]T^2\\\\!\\\\!\\n\\\\int_0^\\\\infty\\\\!\\\\!\\\\!\\\\intensity(\\\\omega)\\\\,\\n\\\\frac{\\\\sin^2[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]}\\n{[(\\\\omega-\\\\omega_0)T/2]^2}\\\\,d\\\\omega.\\\\notag\\n\\\\end{gather}\\n\\nIn general, $\\\\intensity(\\\\omega)$ will vary much more slowly\\nwithÂ\\xa0$\\\\omega$ than the sharp resonance term. The two functions might appear\\nas shown in Fig.Â\\xa09â\\x80\\x938. In such cases, we can\\nreplaceÂ\\xa0$\\\\intensity(\\\\omega)$ by its valueÂ\\xa0$\\\\intensity(\\\\omega_0)$ at the center\\nof the sharp resonance curve and take it outside of the integral. What\\nremains is just the integral under the curve of Fig.Â\\xa09â\\x80\\x937,\\nwhich is, as we have seen, just equal toÂ\\xa0$2\\\\pi/T$. We get the result\\nthat\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:55}\\nP(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)=4\\\\pi^2\\n\\\\biggl[\\\\frac{\\\\mu^2}{4\\\\pi\\\\epsO\\\\hbar^2c}\\\\biggr]\\n\\\\intensity(\\\\omega_0)T.\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nThis is an important result, because it is the general theory of the\\nabsorption of light by any molecular or atomic system. Although we began by\\nconsidering a case in which stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$) had a higher energy than\\nstateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$, none of our arguments depended on that fact.\\nEquationÂ\\xa0(9.55) still holds if the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$ has a\\nlower energy than the stateÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$; then $P(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)$\\nrepresents the probability for a transition with the absorption of energy\\nfrom the incident electromagnetic wave. The absorption of light by any atomic\\nsystem always involves the amplitude for a transition in an oscillating electric\\nfield between two states separated by an energyÂ\\xa0$E=\\\\hbar\\\\omega_0$. For any\\nparticular case, it is always worked out in just the way we have done here and\\ngives an expression like Eq.Â\\xa0(9.55). We, therefore, emphasize the\\nfollowing features of this result. First, the probability is proportional\\ntoÂ\\xa0$T$. In other words, there is a constant probability per unit time that\\ntransitions will occur. Second, this probability is proportional to the\\nintensity of the light incident on the system. Finally, the transition\\nprobability is proportional toÂ\\xa0$\\\\mu^2$, where, you remember, $\\\\mu\\\\Efield$\\ndefined the shift in energy due to the electric fieldÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield$. Because of\\nthis, $\\\\mu\\\\Efield$ also appeared in Eqs. (9.38)\\nandÂ\\xa0(9.39) as the coupling term that is responsible for the\\ntransition between the otherwise stationary states $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$\\nandÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$. In other words, for the smallÂ\\xa0$\\\\Efield$ we have been\\nconsidering, $\\\\mu\\\\Efield$ is the so-called â\\x80\\x9cperturbation termâ\\x80\\x9d in the\\nHamiltonian matrix element which connects the states $\\\\ketsl{\\\\slI}$\\nandÂ\\xa0$\\\\ketsl{\\\\slII}$. In the general case, we would have that $\\\\mu\\\\Efield$ gets\\nreplaced by the matrix elementÂ\\xa0$\\\\bracketsl{\\\\slII}{H}{\\\\slI}$ (see\\nSectionÂ\\xa05â\\x80\\x936).\\n\\nIn VolumeÂ\\xa0I (SectionÂ\\xa042â\\x80\\x935) we talked about the relations\\namong light absorption, induced emission, and spontaneous emission in\\nterms of the Einstein $A$- andÂ\\xa0$B$-coefficients. Here, we have at last\\nthe quantum mechanical procedure for computing these coefficients. What\\nwe have calledÂ\\xa0$P(\\\\slI\\\\to\\\\slII\\\\,)$ for our two-state ammonia molecule\\ncorresponds precisely to the absorption coefficientÂ\\xa0$B_{nm}$ of the\\nEinstein radiation theory. For the complicated ammonia moleculeâ\\x80\\x94which\\nis too difficult for anyone to calculateâ\\x80\\x94we have taken the matrix\\nelementÂ\\xa0$\\\\bracketsl{\\\\slII}{H}{\\\\slI}$ asÂ\\xa0$\\\\mu\\\\Efield$, saying that $\\\\mu$ is\\nto be gotten from experiment. For simpler atomic systems, theÂ\\xa0$\\\\mu_{mn}$\\nwhich belongs to any particular transition can be calculated from the\\ndefinition\\n\\\\begin{equation}\\n\\\\label{Eq:III:9:56}\\n\\\\mu_{mn}\\\\Efield=\\\\bracket{m}{H}{n}=H_{mn},\\n\\\\end{equation}\\n\\nwhere $H_{mn}$ is the matrix element of the Hamiltonian which includes\\nthe effects of a weak electric field. TheÂ\\xa0$\\\\mu_{mn}$ calculated in\\nthis way is called the electric dipole matrix\\nelement. The quantum mechanical\\ntheory of the absorption and emission of light is, therefore, reduced to\\na calculation of these matrix elements for particular atomic systems.\\n\\nOur study of a simple two-state system has thus led us to an\\nunderstanding of the general problem of the absorption and emission of\\nlight.\""
