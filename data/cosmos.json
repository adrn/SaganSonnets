Our feeblest contemplations of theCosmos stir us - there is a tingling in the spine, a catch in the voice, a faint sensation, as if adistant memory, of falling from a height. We know we are approaching the greatest ofmysteries.","12":"The size and age of the Cosmos are beyond ordinary human understanding. Lostsomewhere between immensity and eternity is our tiny planetary home. In a cosmicperspective, most human concerns seem insignificant, even petty. And yet our species isyoung and curious and brave and shows much promise. In the last few millennia we havemade the most astonishing and unexpected discoveries about the Cosmos and our placewithin it, explorations that are exhilarating to consider. They remind us that humans haveevolved to wonder, that understanding is a joy, that knowledge is prerequisite to survival. Ibelieve our future depends on how well we know this Cosmos in which we float like a moteof dust in the morning sky.","13":"Those explorations required skepticism and imagination both. Imagination willoften carry us to worlds that never were. But without it, we go nowhere. Skepticism enablesus to distinguish fancy from fact, to test our speculations. The Cosmos is rich beyondmeasure - in elegant facts, in exquisite interrelationships, in the subtle machinery of awe.","14":"The surface of the Earth is the shore of the cosmic ocean. From it we have learnedmost of what we know. Recently, we have waded a little out to sea, enough to dampen ourtoes or, at most, wet our ankles. The water seems inviting. The ocean calls. Some part ofour being knows this is from where we came. We long to return. These aspirations are not,","15":"I think, irreverent, although they may trouble whatever gods may be.","16":"The dimensions of the Cosmos are so large that using familiar units of distance,such as meters or miles, chosen for their utility on Earth, would make little sense. Instead,we measure distance with the speed of light. In one second a beam of light travels 186,000miles, nearly 300,000 kilometers or seven times around the Earth. In eight minutes it willtravel from the Sun to the Earth. We can say the Sun is eight light-minutes away. In a year,it crosses nearly ten trillion kilometers, about six trillion miles, of intervening space. Thatunit of length, the distance light goes in a year, is called a light-year. It measures not timebut distances - enormous distances.","17":"The Earth is a place. It is by no means the only place. It is not even a typical place.No planet or star or galaxy can be typical, because the Cosmos is mostly empty. The onlytypical place is within the vast, cold, universal vacuum, the everlasting night ofintergalactic space, a place so strange and desolate that, by comparison, planets and starsand galaxies seem achingly rare and lovely. If we were randomly inserted into the Cosmos,the chance that we would find ourselves on or near a planet would be less than one in abillion trillion trillion* (10 , a one followed by 33 zeroes). In everyday life such odds arecalled compelling. Worlds are precious.","18":"* We use the American scientific convention for large numbers: one billion = 1,000,000,000 = 10 9 ;one trillion = 1,000,000,000,000= 10 12 , etc. The exponent counts the number of zeroes after the one.","19":"From an intergalactic vantage point we would see, strewn like sea froth on thewaves of space, innumerable faint, wispy tendrils of light. These are the galaxies. Some aresolitary wanderers; most inhabit communal clusters, huddling together, drifting endlessly inthe great cosmic dark. Before us is the Cosmos on the grandest scale we know. We are inthe realm of the nebulae, eight billion light-years from Earth, halfway to the edge of theknown universe.","20":"A galaxy is composed of gas and dust and stars billions upon billions of stars. Everystar may be a sun to someone. Within a galaxy are stars and worlds and, it may be, aproliferation of living things and intelligent beings and spacefaring civilizations. But fromafar, a galaxy reminds me more of a collection of lovely found objects - seashells, perhaps,or corals, the productions of Nature laboring for aeons in the cosmic ocean.","21":"There are some hundred billion (10 11 ) galaxies, each with, on the average, a hundredbillion stars. In all the galaxies, there are perhaps as many planets as stars, 10 x 10 10\u201c\u201c,","22":"ten billion trillion. In the face of such overpowering numbers, what is the likelihood thatonly one ordinary star, the Sun, is accompanied by an inhabited planet? Why should we,tucked away in some forgotten corner of the Cosmos, be so fortunate? To me, it seems farmore likely that the universe is brimming over with life. But we humans do not yet know.","23":"We are just beginning our explorations. From eight billion light-years away we are hardpressed to find even the cluster in which our Milky Way Galaxy is embedded, much lessthe Sun or the Earth. The only planet we are sure is inhabited is a tiny speck of rock andmetal, shining feebly by reflected sunlight, and at this distance utterly lost.","24":"But presently our journey takes us to what astronomers on Earth like to call theLocal Group of galaxies. Several million light-years across, it is composed of some twentyconstituent galaxies. It is a sparse and obscure and unpretentious cluster. One of thesegalaxies is M31, seen from the Earth in the constellation Andromeda. Like other spiralgalaxies, it is a huge pinwheel of stars, gas and dust. M3 1 has two small satellites, dwarfelliptical galaxies bound to it by gravity, by the identical law of physics that tends to keepme in my chair. The laws of nature are the same throughout the Cosmos. We are now twomillion light-years from home.","25":"Beyond M3 1 is another, very similar galaxy, our own, its spiral arms turning slowly,once every quarter billion years. Now, forty thousand light-years from home, we findourselves falling toward the massive center of the Milky Way. But if we wish to find theEarth, we must redirect our course to the remote outskirts of the Galaxy, to an obscurelocale near the edge of a distant spiral arm.","26":"Our overwhelming impression, even between the spiral arms, is of stars streamingby us - a vast array of exquisitely self-luminous stars, some as flimsy as a soap bubble andso large that they could contain ten thousand Suns or a trillion Earths; others the size of asmall town and a hundred trillion times denser than lead. Some stars are solitary, like theSun. Most have companions. Systems are commonly double, two stars orbiting one another.But there is a continuous gradation from triple systems through loose clusters of a fewdozen stars to the great globular clusters, resplendent with a million suns. Some doublestars are so close that they touch, and starstuff flows beneath them. Most are as separated asJupiter is from the Sun. Some stars, the supernovae, are as bright as the entire galaxy thatcontains them; others, the black holes, are invisible from a few kilometers away. Someshine with a constant brightness; others flicker uncertainly or blink with an unfalteringrhythm. Some rotate in stately elegance; others spin so feverishly that they distortthemselves to oblateness. Most shine mainly in visible and infrared light; others are alsobrilliant sources of X-rays or radio waves. Blue stars are hot and young; yellow stars,conventional and middle-aged; red stars, often elderly and dying; and small white or blackstars are in the final throes of death. The Milky Way contains some 400 billion stars of allsorts moving with a complex and orderly grace. Of all the stars, the inhabitants of Earthknow close-up, so far, but one.","27":"Each star system is an island in space, quarantined from its neighbors by thelight-years. I can imagine creatures evolving into glimmerings of knowledge oninnumerable worlds, every one of them assuming at first their puny planet and paltry fewsuns to be all that is. We grow up in isolation. Only slowly do we teach ourselves theCosmos.","28":"Some stars may be surrounded by millions of lifeless and rocky worldlets, planetarysystems frozen at some early stage in their evolution. Perhaps many stars have planetarysystems rather like our own: at the periphery, great gaseous ringed planets and icy moons,and nearer to the center, small, warm, blue-white, cloud-covered worlds. On some,intelligent life may have evolved, reworking the planetary surface in some massiveengineering enterprise. These are our brothers and sisters in the Cosmos. Are they verydifferent from us? What is their form, biochemistry, neurobiology, history, politics, science,technology, art, music, religion, philosophy? Perhaps some day we will know them.","29":"We have now reached our own backyard, a light-year from Earth. Surrounding ourSun is a spherical swarm of giant snow-balls composed of ice and rock and organicmolecules: the cometary nuclei. Every now and then a passing star gives a tiny gravitationaltug, and one of them obligingly careens into the inner solar system. There the Sun heats it,the ice is vaporized, and a lovely cometary tail develops.","30":"We approach the planets of our system, largish worlds, captives of the Sun,gravitationally constrained to follow nearly circular orbits, heated mainly by sunlight. Pluto,covered with methane ice and accompanied by its solitary giant moon Charon, isilluminated by a distant Sun, which appears as no more than a bright point of light in apitchblack sky. The giant gas worlds, Neptune, Uranus, Saturn - the jewel of the solarsystem - and Jupiter all have an entourage of icy moons. Interior to the region of gassyplanets and orbiting icebergs are the warm, rocky provinces of the inner solar system. Thereis, for example, the red planet Mars, with soaring volcanoes, great rift valleys, enormousplanet-wide sandstorms, and, just possibly, some simple forms of life. All the planets orbitthe Sun, the nearest star, an inferno of hydrogen and helium gas engaged in thermonuclearreactions, flooding the solar system with light.","31":"Finally, at the end of all our wanderings, we return to our tiny, fragile, blue-whiteworld, lost in a cosmic ocean vast beyond our most courageous imaginings. It is a worldamong an immensity of others. It may be significant only for us. The Earth is our home, ourparent. Our kind of life arose and evolved here. The human species is coming of age here. Itis on this world that we developed our passion for exploring the Cosmos, and it is here thatwe are, in some pain and with no guarantees, working out our destiny.","32":"Welcome to the planet Earth - a place of blue nitrogen skies, oceans of liquid water,cool forests and soft meadows, a world positively rippling with life. In the cosmicperspective it is, as I have said, poignantly beautiful and rare; but it is also, for the moment,unique. In all our journeying through space and time, it is, so far, the only world on whichwe know with certainty that the matter of the Cosmos has become alive and aware. Theremust be many such worlds scattered through space, but our search for them begins here,with the accumulated wisdom of the men and women of our species, garnered at great costover a million years. We are privileged to live among brilliant and passionately inquisitivepeople, and in a time when the search for knowledge is generally prized. Human beings,born ultimately of the stars and now for a while inhabiting a world called Earth, have beguntheir long voyage home.","33":"The discovery that the Earth is a little world was made, as so many importanthuman discoveries were, in the ancient Near East, in a time some humans call the thirdcentury B.C., in the greatest metropolis of the age, the Egyptian city of Alexandria. Herethere lived a man named Eratosthenes. One of his envious contemporaries called him\u2018Beta,\u2019 the second letter of the Greek alphabet, because, he said, Eratosthenes was secondbest in the world in everything. But it seems clear that in almost everything Eratostheneswas \u2018Alpha.\u2019 He was an astronomer, historian, geographer, philosopher, poet, theater criticand mathematician. The titles of the books he wrote range from Astronomy to On Freedomfrom Pain. He was also the director of the great library of Alexandria, where one day heread in a papyrus book that in the southern frontier outpost of Syene, near the first cataractof the Nile, at noon on June 21 vertical sticks cast no shadows. On the summer solstice, thelongest day of the year, as the hours crept toward midday, the shadows of temple columnsgrew shorter. At noon, they were gone. A reflection of the Sun could then be seen in thewater at the bottom of a deep well. The Sun was directly overhead.","34":"It was an observation that someone else might easily have ignored. Sticks, shadows,reflections in wells, the position of the Sun - of what possible importance could such simpleeveryday matters be? But Eratosthenes was a scientist, and his musings on thesecommonplaces changed the world; in a way, they made the world. Eratosthenes had thepresence of mind to do an experiment, actually to observe whether in Alexandria verticalsticks cast shadows near noon on June 21. And, he discovered, sticks do.","35":"Eratosthenes asked himself how, at the same moment, a stick in Syene could cast noshadow and a stick in Alexandria, far to the north, could cast a pronounced shadow.Consider a map of ancient Egypt with two vertical sticks of equal length, one stuck inAlexandria, the other in Syene. Suppose that, at a certain moment, each stick casts noshadow at all. This is perfectly easy to understand - provided the Earth is flat. The Sunwould then be directly overhead. If the two sticks cast shadows of equal length, that alsowould make sense on a flat Earth: the Sun\u2019s rays would then be inclined at the same angleto the two sticks. But how could it be that at the same instant there was no shadow at Syeneand a substantial shadow at Alexandria?","36":"The only possible answer, he saw, was that the surface of the Earth is curved. Notonly that: the greater the curvature, the greater the difference in the shadow lengths. TheSun is so far away that its rays are parallel when they reach the Earth. Sticks placed atdifferent angles to the Sun\u2019s rays cast shadows of different lengths. For the observeddifference in the shadow lengths, the distance between Alexandria and Syene had to beabout seven degrees along the surface of the Earth; that is, if you imagine the sticksextending down to the center of the Earth, they would there intersect at an angle of sevendegrees. Seven degrees is something like one-fiftieth of three hundred and sixty degrees,the full circumference of the Earth. Eratosthenes knew that the distance betweenAlexandria and Syene was approximately 800 kilometers, because he hired a man to pace itout. Eight hundred kilometers times 50 is 40,000 kilometers: so that must be thecircumference of the Earth.*","37":"* Or if you like to measure things in miles, the distance between Alexandria and Syene is about 500miles, and 500 miles x 50 = 25,000 miles.","38":"This is the right answer. Eratosthenes\u2019 only tools were sticks, eyes, feet and brains,plus a taste for experiment. With them he deduced the circumference of the Earth with anerror of only a few percent, a remarkable achievement for 2,200 years ago. He was the firstperson accurately to measure the size of a planet.","39":"The Mediterranean world at that time was famous for seafaring. Alexandria was thegreatest seaport on the planet. Once you knew the Earth to be a sphere of modest diameter,would you not be tempted to make voyages of exploration, to seek out undiscovered lands,perhaps even to attempt to sail around the planet? Four hundred years before Eratosthenes,Africa had been circumnavigated by a Phoenician fleet in the employ of the EgyptianPharaoh Necho. They set sail, probably in frail open boats, from the Red Sea, turned downthe east coast of Africa up into the Atlantic, returning through the Mediterranean. This epicjourney took three years, about as long as a modern Voyager spacecraft takes to fly fromEarth to Saturn.","40":"After Eratosthenes\u2019 discovery, many great voyages were attempted by brave andventuresome sailors. Their ships were tiny. They had only rudimentary navigationalinstruments. They used dead reckoning and followed coastlines as far as they could. In anunknown ocean they could determine their latitude, but not their longitude, by observing,night after night, the position of the constellations with respect to the horizon. The familiarconstellations must have been reassuring in the midst of an unexplored ocean. The stars arethe friends of explorers, then with seagoing ships on Earth and now with spacefaring shipsin the sky. After Eratosthenes, some may have tried, but not until the time of Magellan didanyone succeed in circumnavigating the Earth. What tales of daring and adventure mustearlier have been recounted as sailors and navigators, practical men of the world, gambledtheir lives on the mathematics of a scientist from Alexandria?","41":"In Eratosthenes\u2019 time, globes were constructed portraying the Earth as viewed fromspace; they were essentially correct in the well-explored Mediterranean but became moreand more inaccurate the farther they strayed from home. Our present knowledge of theCosmos shares this disagreeable but inevitable feature. In the first century, the Alexandriangeographer Strabo wrote:","42":"Those who have returned from an attempt to circumnavigate the Earth do not saythey have been prevented by an opposing continent, for the sea remained perfectlyopen, but, rather, through want of resolution and scarcity of provision ....Eratosthenes says that if the extent of the Atlantic Ocean were not an obstacle, wemight easily pass by sea from Iberia to India .... It is quite possible that in thetemperate zone there may be one or two habitable Earths .... Indeed, if [this otherpart of the world] is inhabited, it is not inhabited by men such as exist in our parts,and we should have to regard it as another inhabited world.","43":"Humans were beginning to venture, in almost every sense that matters, to other worlds.","44":"The subsequent exploration of the Earth was a worldwide endeavor, includingvoyages from as well as to China and Polynesia. The culmination was, of course, thediscovery of America by Christopher Columbus and the journeys of the following fewcenturies, which completed the geographical exploration of the Earth. Columbus\u2019 firstvoyage is connected in the most straight-forward way with the calculations of Eratosthenes.Columbus was fascinated by what he called \u2018the Enterprise of the Indies,\u2019 a project to reachJapan, China and India not by following the coastline of Africa and sailing East but ratherby plunging boldly into the unknown Western ocean - or, as Eratosthenes had said withstartling prescience, \u2018to pass by sea from Iberia to India.\u2019","45":"Columbus had been an itinerant peddler of old maps and an assiduous reader of thebooks by and about the ancient geographers, including Eratosthenes, Strabo and Ptolemy.But for the Enterprise of the Indies to work, for ships and crews to survive the long voyage,the Earth had to be smaller than Eratosthenes had said. Columbus therefore cheated on hiscalculations, as the examining faculty of the University of Salamanca quite correctlypointed out. He used the smallest possible circumference of the Earth and the greatesteastward extension of Asia he could find in all the books available to him, and thenexaggerated even those. Had the Americas not been in the way, Columbus\u2019 expeditionswould have failed utterly.","46":"The Earth is now thoroughly explored. It no longer promises new continents or lostlands. But the technology that allowed us to explore and inhabit the most remote regions ofthe Earth now permits us to leave our planet, to venture into space, to explore other worlds.Leaving the Earth, we are now able to view it from above, to see its solid spherical shape ofEratosthenian dimensions and the outlines of its continents, confirming that many of theancient mapmakers were remarkably competent. What a pleasure such a view would havegiven to Eratosthenes and the other Alexandrian geographers.","47":"It was in Alexandria, during the six hundred years beginning around 300 B.C., thathuman beings, in an important sense, began the intellectual adventure that has led us to theshores of space. But of the look and feel of that glorious marble city, nothing remains.Oppression and the fear of learning have obliterated almost all memory of ancientAlexandria. Its population was marvelously diverse. Macedonian and later Roman soldiers,Egyptian priests, Greek aristocrats, Phoenician sailors, Jewish merchants, visitors fromIndia and sub-Saharan Africa - everyone, except the vast slave population - lived togetherin harmony and mutual respect for most of the period of Alexandria\u2019s greatness.","48":"The city was founded by Alexander the Great and constructed by his formerbodyguard. Alexander encouraged respect for alien cultures and the open-minded pursuit ofknowledge. According to tradition - and it does not much matter whether it really happened- he descended beneath the Red Sea in the world\u2019s first diving bell. He encouraged hisgenerals and soldiers to marry Persian and Indian women. He respected the gods of othernations. He collected exotic lifeforms, including an elephant for Aristotle, his teacher. Hiscity was constructed on a lavish scale, to be the world center of commerce, culture andlearning. It was graced with broad avenues thirty meters wide, elegant architecture andstatuary, Alexander\u2019s monumental tomb, and an enormous lighthouse, the Pharos, one ofthe seven wonders of the ancient world.","49":"But the greatest marvel of Alexandria was the library and its associated museum(literally, an institution devoted to the specialties of the Nine Muses). Of that legendarylibrary, the most that survives today is a dank and forgotten cellar of the Serapeum, thelibrary annex, once a temple and later reconsecrated to knowledge. A few molderingshelves may be its only physical remains. Yet this place was once the brain and glory of thegreatest city on the planet, the first true research institute in the history of the world. Thescholars of the library studied the entire Cosmos. Cosmos is a Greek word for the order ofthe universe. It is, in a way, the opposite of Chaos. It implies the deep interconnectednessof all things. It conveys awe for the intricate and subtle way in which the universe is puttogether. Here was a community of scholars, exploring physics, literature, medicine,astronomy, geography, philosophy, mathematics, biology, and engineering. Science andscholarship had come of age. Genius flourished there. The Alexandrian Library is where wehumans first collected, seriously and systematically, the knowledge of the world.","50":"In addition to Eratosthenes, there was the astronomer Hiparchus, who mapped theconstellations and estimated the brightness of the stars; Euclid, who brilliantly systematizedgeometry and told his king, struggling over a difficult mathematical problem, \u2018There is noroyal road to geometry\u2019; Dionysius of Thrace, the man who defined the parts of speech anddid for the study of language what Euclid did for geometry; Herophilus, the physiologistwho firmly established that the brain rather than the heart is the seat of intelligence; Heronof Alexandria, inventor of gear trains and steam engines and the author of Automata, thefirst book on robots; Apollonius of Perga, the mathematician who demonstrated the formsof the conic sections* - ellipse, parabola and hyperbola - the curves, as we now know,followed in their orbits by the planets, the comets and the stars; Archimedes, the greatestmechanical genius until Leonardo da Vinci; and the astronomer and geographer Ptolemy,who compiled much of what is today the pseudoscience of astrology: his Earth-centereduniverse held sway for 1,500 years, a reminder that intellectual capacity is no guaranteeagainst being dead wrong. And among those great men was a great woman, Hypatia,mathematician and astronomer, the last light of the library, whose martyrdom was bound upwith the destruction of the library seven centuries after its founding, a story to which wewill return.","51":"*So called because they can be produced by slicing through a cone at various angles. Eighteencenturies later, the writings of Apollonius on conic sections would be employed by Johannes Kepler inunderstanding for the first time the movement of the planets.","52":"The Greek Kings of Egypt who succeeded Alexander were serious about learning.For centuries, they supported research and maintained in the library a working environmentfor the best minds of the age. It contained ten large research halls, each devoted to aseparate subject; fountains and colonnades; botanical gardens; a zoo; dissecting rooms; anobservatory; and a great dining hall where, at leisure, was conducted the critical discussionof ideas.","53":"The heart of the library was its collection of books. The organizers combed all thecultures and languages of the world. They sent agents abroad to buy up libraries.Commercial ships docking in Alexandria were searched by the police - not for contraband,but for books. The scrolls were borrowed, copied and then returned to their owners.Accurate numbers are difficult to estimate, but it seems probable that the Library containedhalf a million volumes, each a handwritten papyrus scroll. What happened to all thosebooks? The classical civilization that created them disintegrated, and the library itself wasdeliberately destroyed. Only a small fraction of its works survived, along with a fewpathetic scattered fragments. And how tantalizing those bits and pieces are! We know, forexample, that there was on the library shelves a book by the astronomer Aristarchus ofSamos, who argued that the Earth is one of the planets, which like them orbits the Sun, andthat the stars are enormously far away. Each of these conclusions is entirely correct, but wehad to wait nearly two thousand years for their rediscovery. If we multiply by a hundred","54":"thousand our sense of loss for this work of Aristarchus, we begin to appreciate the grandeurof the achievement of classical civilization and the tragedy of its destruction.","55":"We have far surpassed the science known to the ancient world. But there areirreparable gaps in our historical knowledge. Imagine what mysteries about our past couldbe solved with a borrower\u2019s card to the Alexandrian Library. We know of a three-volumehistory of the world, now lost, by a Babylonian priest named Berossus. The first volumedealt with the interval from the Creation to the Flood, a period he took to be 432,000 yearsor about a hundred times longer than the Old Testament chronology. I wonder what was init.","56":"The ancients knew that the world is very old. They sought to look into the distantpast. We now know that the Cosmos is far older than they ever imagined. We haveexamined the universe in space and seen that we live on a mote of dust circling a humdrumstar in the remotest corner of an obscure galaxy. And if we are a speck in the immensity ofspace, we also occupy an instant in the expanse of ages. We now know that our universe -or at least its most recent incarnation - is some fifteen or twenty billion years old. This isthe time since a remarkable explosive event called the Big Bang. At the beginning of thisuniverse, there were no galaxies, stars or planets, no life or civilizations, merely a uniform,radiant fireball filling all of space. The passage from the Chaos of the Big Bang to theCosmos that we are beginning to know is the most awesome transformation of matter andenergy that we have been privileged to glimpse. And until we find more intelligent beingselsewhere, we are ourselves the most spectacular of all the transformations - the remotedescendants of the Big Bang, dedicated to understanding and further transforming theCosmos from which we spring.","57":"One Voice in the Cosmic Fugue","58":"I am bidden to surrender myself to the Lord of the Worlds.","59":"He it is who created you of the dust . . .","60":"- The Koran, Sura 40","61":"The oldest of all philosophies, that of Evolution, was bound hand and foot and castinto utter darkness during the millennium of theological scholasticism.

May it not be that, at least, the brighter stars are likeour Sun, the upholding and energizing centres of systems of worlds, adapted to bethe abode of living beings?","66":"- William Huggins, 1865","67":"All my life I have wondered about the possibility of life elsewhere. What would it be like?Of what would it be made? All living things on our planet are constructed of organicmolecules - complex microscopic architectures in which the carbon atom plays a centralrole. There was once a time before life, when the Earth was barren and utterly desolate. Ourworld is now overflowing with life. How did it come about? How, in the absence of life,were carbon-based organic molecules made? How did the first living things arise? How didlife evolve to produce beings as elaborate and complex as we, able to explore the mysteryof our own origins?","68":"And on the countless other planets that may circle other suns, is there life also?

Dozens of different kinds of organic molecules have been found there by radiotelescopes. The abundance of these molecules suggests that the stuff of life is everywhere.Perhaps the origin and evolution of life is, given enough time, a cosmic inevitability. Onsome of the billions of planets in the Milky Way Galaxy, life may never arise. On others, itmay arise and die out, or never evolve beyond its simplest forms. And on some smallfraction of worlds there may develop intelligences and civilizations more advanced thanour own.","71":"Occasionally someone remarks on what a lucky coincidence it is that the Earth isperfectly suitable for life - moderate temperatures, liquid water, oxygen atmosphere, and soon. But this is, at least in part, a confusion of cause and effect. We earthlings are supremelywell adapted to the environment of the Earth because we grew up here. Those earlier formsof life that were not well adapted died. We are descended from the organisms that did well.Organisms that evolve on a quite different world will doubtless sing its praises too.","72":"All life on Earth is closely related.

In theyear 1185, the Emperor of Japan was a seven-year-old boy named Antoku. He was thenominal leader of a clan of samurai called the Heike, who were engaged in a long andbloody war with another samurai clan, the Genji. Each asserted a superior ancestral claim tothe imperial throne. Their decisive naval encounter, with the Emperor on board ship,occurred at Danno-ura in the Japanese Inland Sea on April 24, 1185. The Heike wereoutnumbered, and outmaneuvered. Many were killed. The survivors, in massive numbers,threw themselves into the sea and drowned. The Lady Nii, grandmother of the Emperor,resolved that she and Antoku would not be captured by the enemy. What happened next istold in The Tale of the Heike:","74":"The Emperor was seven years old that year but looked much older. He was solovely that he seemed to shed a brilliant radiance and his long, black hair hung loosefar down his back. With a look of surprise and anxiety on his face he asked theLady Nii, \u2018Where are you to take me?\u2019","75":"She turned to the youthful sovereign, with tears streaming down her cheeks,and . . . comforted him, binding up his long hair in his dove-colored robe. Blindedwith tears, the child sovereign put his beautiful, small hands together. He turnedfirst to the East to say farewell to the god of Ise and then to the West to repeat theNembutsu [a prayer to the Amida Buddha]. The Lady Nii took him tightly in her","76":"arms and with the words \u2018In the depths of the ocean is our capitol,\u2019 sank with him at","77":"last beneath the waves.","78":"The entire Heike battle fleet was destroyed. Only forty-three women survived. Theseladies-in-waiting of the imperial court were forced to sell flowers and other favors to thefishermen near the scene of the battle. The Heike almost vanished from history. But aragtag group of the former ladies-in-waiting and their offspring by the fisher-folkestablished a festival to commemorate the battle. It takes place on the twenty-fourth ofApril every year to this day. Fishermen who are the descendants of the Heike dress in hempand black headgear and proceed to the Akama shrine which contains the mausoleum of thedrowned Emperor. There they watch a play portraying the events that followed the Battle ofDanno-ura. For centuries after, people imagined that they could discern ghostly samuraiarmies vainly striving to bail the sea, to cleanse it of blood and defeat and humiliation.","79":"The fishermen say the Heike samurai wander the bottoms of the Inland Sea still - inthe form of crabs. There are crabs to be found here with curious markings on their backs,patterns and indentations that disturbingly resemble the face of a samurai. When caught,these crabs are not eaten, but are returned to the sea in commemoration of the dolefulevents at Danno-ura.","80":"This legend raises a lovely problem. How does it come about that the face of awarrior is incised on the carapace of a crab? The answer seems to be that humans made theface. The patterns on the crab\u2019s shell are inherited. But among crabs, as among people,there are many different hereditary lines. Suppose that, by chance, among the distantancestors of this crab, one arose with a pattern that resembled, even slightly, a human face.Even before the battle of Danno-ura, fishermen may have been reluctant to eat such a crab.In throwing it back, they set in motion an evolutionary process: If you are a crab and yourcarapace is ordinary, the humans will eat you. Your line will leave fewer descendants. Ifyour carapace looks a little like a face, they will throw you back. You will leave moredescendants. Crabs had a substantial investment in the patterns on their carapaces. As thegenerations passed, of crabs and fishermen alike, the crabs with patterns that mostresembled a samurai face survived preferentially until eventually there was produced notjust a human face, not just a Japanese face, but the visage of a fierce and scowling samurai.All this has nothing to do with what the crabs want. Selection is imposed from the outside.The more you look like a samurai, the better are your chances of survival. Eventually, therecome to be a great many samurai crabs.","81":"This process is called artificial selection. In the case of the Heike crab it waseffected more or less unconsciously by the fishermen, and certainly without any seriouscontemplation by the crabs. But humans have deliberately selected which plants andanimals shall live and which shall die for thousands of years. We are surrounded frombabyhood by familiar farm and domestic animals, fruits and trees and vegetables. Where dothey come from? Were they once free-living in the wild and then induced to adopt a lessstrenuous life on the farm? No, the truth is quite different. They are, most of them, made byus.","82":"Ten thousand years ago, there were no dairy cows or ferret hounds or large ears of","83":"corn. When we domesticated the ancestors of these plants and animals - sometimescreatures who looked quite different - we controlled their breeding. We made sure thatcertain varieties, having properties we consider desirable, preferentially reproduced. Whenwe wanted a dog to help us care for sheep, we selected breeds that were intelligent,obedient and had some pre-existing talent to herd, which is useful for animals who hunt inpacks. The enormous distended udders of dairy cattle are the result of a human interest inmilk and cheese. Our corn, or maize, has been bred for ten thousand generations to be moretasty and nutritious than its scrawny ancestors; indeed, it is so changed that it cannot evenreproduce without human intervention.","84":"The essence of artificial selection - for a Heike crab, a dog, a cow or an ear of corn -is this: Many physical and behavioral traits of plants and animals are inherited. They breedtrue. Humans, for whatever reason, encourage the reproduction of some varieties anddiscourage the reproduction of others. The variety selected for preferentially reproduces; iteventually becomes abundant; the variety selected against becomes rare and perhapsextinct.","85":"But if humans can make new varieties of plants and animals, must not nature do soalso? This related process is called natural selection. That life has changed fundamentallyover the aeons is entirely clear from the alterations we have made in the beasts andvegetables during the short tenure of humans on Earth, and from the fossil evidence. Thefossil record speaks to us unambiguously of creatures that once were present in enormousnumbers and that have now vanished utterly.* Far more species have become extinct in thehistory of the Earth than exist today; they are the terminated experiments of evolution.","86":"* Although traditional Western religious opinion stoutly maintained the contrary, as for example, the1770 opinion of John Wesley: \u2018Death is never permitted to destroy [even] the most inconsiderable species.\u2019","87":"The genetic changes induced by domestication have occurred very rapidly. Therabbit was not domesticated until early medieval times (it was bred by French monks in thebelief that new-born bunnies were fish and therefore exempt from the prohibitions againsteating meat on certain days in the Church calendar); coffee in the fifteenth century; thesugar beet in the nineteenth century; and the mink is still in the earliest stages ofdomestication. In less than ten thousand years, domestication has increased the weight ofwool grown by sheep from less than one kilogram of rough hairs to ten or twenty kilogramsof uniform, fine down; or the volume of milk given by cattle during a lactation period froma few hundred to a million cubic centimeters. If artificial selection can make such majorchanges in so short a period of time, what must natural selection, working over billions ofyears, be capable of? The answer is all the beauty and diversity of the biological world.Evolution is a fact, not a theory.","88":"That the mechanism of evolution is natural selection is the great discoveryassociated with the names of Charles Darwin and Alfred Russel Wallace. More than acentury ago, they stressed that nature is prolific, that many more animals and plants areborn than can possibly survive and that therefore the environment selects those varietieswhich are, by accident, better suited for survival. Mutations - sudden changes in heredity -breed true. They provide the raw material of evolution. The environment selects those few","89":"mutations that enhance survival, resulting in a series of slow transformations of onelifeform into another, the origin of new species.*","90":"* In the Mayan holy book the Popol Vuh, the various forms of life are described as unsuccessfulattempts by gods with a predilection for experiment to make people. Early tries were far off the mark, creatingthe lower animals; the penultimate attempt, a near miss, made the monkeys. In Chinese myth, human beingsarose from the body lice of a god named P\u2019an Ku. In the eighteenth century, de Buffon proposed that theEarth was much older than Scripture suggested, that the forms of life somehow changed slowly over themillennia, but that the apes were the forlorn descendants of people. While these notions do not preciselyreflect the evolutionary process described by Darwin and Wallace, they are anticipations of it - as are theviews of Democritus, Empedocles and other early Ionian scientists who are discussed in Chapter 7.","91":"Darwin\u2019s words in The Origin of Species were:","92":"Man does not actually produce variability; he only unintentionally exposes organicbeings to new conditions of life, and then Nature acts on the organisation, andcauses variability. But man can and does select the variations given to him byNature, and thus accumulate them in any desired manner. He thus adapts animalsand plants for his own benefit or pleasure. He may do this methodically, or he maydo it unconsciously by preserving the individuals most useful to him at the time,without any thought of altering the breed .... There is no obvious reason why theprinciples which have acted so efficiently under domestication should not haveacted under Nature .... More individuals are born than can possibly survive ....The slightest advantage in one being, of any age or during any season, over thosewith which it comes into competition, or better adaptation in however slight adegree to the surrounding physical conditions, will turn the balance.","93":"T. H. Huxley, the most effective nineteenth-century defender and popularizer of evolution,wrote that the publications of Darwin and Wallace were a \u2018flash of light, which to a manwho has lost himself in a dark night, suddenly reveals a road which, whether it takes himstraight home or not, certainly goes his way .... My reflection, when I first made myselfmaster of the central idea of the \u2018Origin of Species,\u2019 was, \u2018How extremely stupid not tohave thought of that!\u2019 I suppose that Columbus\u2019 companions said much the same .... Thefacts of variability, of the struggle for existence, of adaptation to conditions, were notoriousenough; but none of us had suspected that the road to the heart of the species problem laythrough them, until Darwin and Wallace dispelled the darkness.\u2019","94":"Many people were scandalized - some still are - at both ideas, evolution and naturalselection. Our ancestors looked at the elegance of life on Earth, at how appropriate thestructures of organisms are to their functions, and saw evidence for a Great Designer. Thesimplest one-celled organism is a far more complex machine than the finest pocket watch.And yet pocket watches do not spontaneously self-assemble, or evolve, in slow stages, ontheir own, from, say, grandfather clocks. A watch implies a watchmaker. There seemed tobe no way in which atoms and molecules could somehow spontaneously fall together tocreate organisms of such awesome complexity and subtle functioning as grace every regionof the Earth. That each living thing was specially designed, that one species did not become","95":"another, were notions perfectly consistent with what our ancestors with their limitedhistorical records knew about life. The idea that every organism was meticulouslyconstructed by a Great Designer provided a significance and order to nature and animportance to human beings that we crave still. A Designer is a natural, appealing andaltogether human explanation of the biological world. But, as Darwin and Wallace showed,there is another way, equally appealing, equally human, and far more compelling: naturalselection, which makes the music of life more beautiful as the aeons pass.","96":"The fossil evidence could be consistent with the idea of a Great Designer; perhapssome species are destroyed when the Designer becomes dissatisfied with them, and newexperiments are attempted on an improved design. But this notion is a little disconcerting.Each plant and animal is exquisitely made; should not a supremely competent Designerhave been able to make the intended variety from the start? The fossil record implies trialand error, an inability to anticipate the future, features inconsistent with an efficient GreatDesigner (although not with a Designer of a more remote and indirect temperament).","97":"When I was a college undergraduate in the early 1950\u2019s, I was fortunate enough towork in the laboratory of H. J. Muller, a great geneticist and the man who discovered thatradiation produces mutations. Muller was the person who first called my attention to theHeike crab as an example of artificial selection. To learn the practical side of genetics, Ispent many months working with fruit flies, Drosophila melanogaster (which means theblack-bodied dew-lover) - tiny benign beings with two wings and big eyes. We kept themin pint milk bottles. We would cross two varieties to see what new forms emerged from therearrangement of the parental genes, and from natural and induced mutations. The femaleswould deposit their eggs on a kind of molasses the technicians placed inside the bottles; thebottles were stoppered; and we would wait two weeks for the fertilized eggs to becomelarvae, the larvae pupae, and the pupae to emerge as new adult fruit flies.","98":"One day I was looking through a low-power binocular microscope at a newlyarrived batch of adult Drosophila immobilized with a little ether, and was busily separatingthe different varieties with a camel\u2019 s-hair brush. To my astonishment, I came uponsomething very different: not a small variation such as red eyes instead of white, or neckbristles instead of no neck bristles. This was another, and very well-functioning, kind ofcreature with much more prominent wings and long feathery antennae. Fate had arranged, Iconcluded, that an example of a major evolutionary change in a single generation, the verything Muller had said could never happen, should take place in his own laboratory. It wasmy unhappy task to explain it to him.","99":"With heavy heart I knocked on his office door. \u2018Come in,\u2019 came the muffled cry. Ientered to discover the room darkened except for a single small lamp illuminating the stageof the microscope at which he was working. In these gloomy surroundings I stumbledthrough my explanation. I had found a very different kind of fly. I was sure it had emergedfrom one of the pupae in the molasses. I didn\u2019t mean to disturb Muller but... \u2018Does it lookmore like Lepidoptera than Diptera?\u2019 he asked, his face illuminated from below. I didn\u2019tknow what this meant, so he had to explain: \u2018Does it have big wings? Does it have featheryantennae?\u2019 I glumly nodded assent.","100":"Muller switched on the overhead light and smiled benignly. It was an old story.There was a kind of moth that had adapted to Drosphila genetics laboratories. It was","101":"nothing like a fruit fly and wanted nothing to do with fruit flies. What it wanted was thefruit flies\u2019 molasses. In the brief time that the laboratory technician took to unstopper andstopper the milk bottle - for example, to add fruit flies - the mother moth made adive-bombing pass, dropping her eggs on the run into the tasty molasses. I had notdiscovered a macro-mutation. I had merely stumbled upon another lovely adaptation innature, itself the product of micromutation and natural selection.","102":"The secrets of evolution are death and time - the deaths of enormous numbers oflifeforms that were imperfectly adapted to the environment; and time for a long successionof small mutations that were by accident adaptive, time for the slow accumulation ofpatterns of favorable mutations. Part of the resistance to Darwin and Wallace derives fromour difficulty in imagining the passage of the millennia, much less the aeons. What doesseventy million years mean to beings who live only one-millionth as long? We are likebutterflies who flutter for a day and think it is forever.","103":"What happened here on Earth may be more or less typical of the evolution of life on manyworlds; but in such details as the chemistry of proteins or the neurology of brains, the storyof life on Earth may be unique in all the Milky Way Galaxy. The Earth condensed out ofinterstellar gas and dust some 4.6 billion years ago. We know from the fossil record that theorigin of life happened soon after, perhaps around 4.0 billion years ago, in the ponds andoceans of the primitive Earth. The first living things were not anything so complex as aone-celled organism, already a highly sophisticated form of life. The first stirrings weremuch more humble. In those early days, lightning and ultraviolet light from the Sun werebreaking apart the simple hydrogen-rich molecules of the primitive atmosphere, thefragments spontaneously recombining into more and more complex molecules. Theproducts of this early chemistry were dissolved in the oceans, forming a kind of organicsoup of gradually increasing complexity, until one day, quite by accident, a molecule arosethat was able to make crude copies of itself, using as building blocks other molecules in thesoup. (We will return to this subject later.)","104":"This was the earliest ancestor of deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA, the master moleculeof life on Earth. It is shaped like a ladder twisted into a helix, the rungs available in fourdifferent molecular parts, which constitute the four letters of the genetic code. These rungs,called nucleotides, spell out the hereditary instructions for making a given organism. Everylifeform on Earth has a different set of instructions, written out in essentially the samelanguage. The reason organisms are different is the differences in their nucleic acidinstructions. A mutation is a change in a nucleotide, copied in the next generation, whichbreeds true. Since mutations are random nucleotide changes, most of them are harmful orlethal, coding into existence nonfunctional enzymes. It is a long wait before a mutationmakes an organism work better. And yet it is that improbable event, a small beneficialmutation in a nucleotide a ten-millionth of a centimeter across, that makes evolution go.","105":"Four billion years ago, the Earth was a molecular Garden of Eden. There were asyet no predators. Some molecules reproduced themselves inefficiently, competed forbuilding blocks and left crude copies of themselves. With reproduction, mutation and theselective elimination of the least efficient varieties, evolution was well under way, even atthe molecular level. As time went on, they got better at reproducing. Molecules withspecialized functions eventually joined together, making a kind of molecular collective -the first cell. Plant cells today have tiny molecular factories, called chloroplasts, which arein charge of photosynthesis - the conversion of sunlight, water and carbon dioxide intocarbohydrates and oxygen. The cells in a drop of blood contain a different sort of molecularfactory, the mitochondrion, which combines food with oxygen to extract useful energy.These factories exist in plant and animal cells today but may once themselves have beenfree-living cells.","106":"By three billion years ago, a number of one-celled plants had joined together,perhaps because a mutation prevented a single cell from separating after splitting in two.The first multicellular organisms had evolved. Every cell of your body is a kind ofcommune, with once free-living parts all banded together for the common good. And youare made of a hundred trillion cells. We are, each of us, a multitude.","107":"Sex seems to have been invented around two billion years ago. Before then, newvarieties of organisms could arise only from the accumulation of random mutations - theselection of changes, letter by letter, in the genetic instructions. Evolution must have beenagonizingly slow. With the invention of sex, two organisms could exchange wholeparagraphs, pages and books of their DNA code, producing new varieties ready for thesieve of selection. Organisms are selected to engage in sex - the ones that find ituninteresting quickly become extinct. And this is true not only of the microbes of twobillion years ago. We humans also have a palpable devotion to exchanging segments ofDNA today.","108":"By one billion years ago, plants, working cooperatively, had made a stunningchange in the environment of the Earth. Green plants generate molecular oxygen. Since theoceans were by now filled with simple green plants, oxygen was becoming a majorconstituent of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, altering it irreversibly from its originalhydrogen-rich character and ending the epoch of Earth history when the stuff of life wasmade by nonbiological processes. But oxygen tends to make organic molecules fall topieces. Despite our fondness for it, it is fundamentally a poison for unprotected organicmatter. The transition to an oxidizing atmosphere posed a supreme crisis in the history oflife, and a great many organisms, unable to cope with oxygen, perished. A few primitiveforms, such as the botulism and tetanus bacilli, manage to survive even today only inoxygen-free environments. The nitrogen in the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is much morechemically inert and therefore much more benign than oxygen. But it, too, is biologicallysustained. Thus, 99 percent of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere is of biological origin. The sky ismade by life.","109":"For most of the four billion years since the origin of life, the dominant organismswere microscopic blue-green algae, which covered and filled the oceans. Then some 600million years ago, the monopolizing grip of the algae was broken and an enormousproliferation of new lifeforms emerged, an event called the Cambrian explosion. Life hadarisen almost immediately after the origin of the Earth, which suggests that life may be aninevitable chemical process on an Earth-like planet. But life did not evolve much beyondblue-green algae for three billion years, which suggests that large lifeforms with specializedorgans are hard to evolve, harder even than the origin of life. Perhaps there are many otherplanets that today have abundant microbes but no big beasts and vegetables.","110":"Soon after the Cambrian explosion, the oceans teemed with many different forms oflife. By 500 million years ago there were vast herds of trilobites, beautifully constructedanimals, a little like large insects; some hunted in packs on the ocean floor. They storedcrystals in their eyes to detect polarized light. But there are no trilobites alive today; therehave been none for 200 million years. The Earth used to be inhabited by plants and animalsof which there is today no living trace. And of course every species now on the planet oncedid not exist. There is no hint in the old rocks of animals like us. Species appear, abidemore or less briefly and then flicker out.","111":"Before the Cambrian explosion species seem to have succeeded one another ratherslowly. In part this may be because the richness of our information declines rapidly thefarther into the past we peer; in the early history of our planet, few organisms had hardparts and soft beings leave few fossil remains. But in part the sluggish rate of appearance ofdramatically new forms before the Cambrian explosion is real; the painstaking evolution ofcell structure and biochemistry is not immediately reflected in the external forms revealedby the fossil record. After the Cambrian explosion, exquisite new adaptations followed oneanother with comparatively breathtaking speed. In rapid succession, the first fish and thefirst vertebrates appeared; plants, previously restricted to the oceans, began the colonizationof the land; the first insect evolved, and its descendants became the pioneers in thecolonization of the land by animals; winged insects arose together with the amphibians,creatures something like the lungfish, able to survive both on land and in the water; the firsttrees and the first reptiles appeared; the dinosaurs evolved; the mammals emerged, and thenthe first birds; the first flowers appeared; the dinosaurs became extinct; the earliestcetaceans, ancestors to the dolphins and whales, arose and in the same period the primates -the ancestors of the monkeys, the apes and the humans. Less than ten million years ago, thefirst creatures who closely resembled human beings evolved, accompanied by a spectacularincrease in brain size. And then, only a few million years ago, the first true humansemerged.","112":"Human beings grew up in forests; we have a natural affinity for them. How lovely atree is, straining toward the sky. Its leaves harvest sunlight to photosynthesize, so treescompete by shadowing their neighbors. If you look closely you can often see two treespushing and shoving with languid grace. Trees are great and beautiful machines, poweredby sunlight, taking in water from the ground and carbon dioxide from the air, convertingthese materials into food for their use and ours. The plant uses the carbohydrates it makesas an energy source to go about its planty business. And we animals, who are ultimatelyparasites on the plants, steal the carbohydrates so we can go about our business. In eatingthe plants we combine the carbohydrates with oxygen dissolved in our blood because of ourpenchant for breathing air, and so extract the energy that makes us go. In the process weexhale carbon dioxide, which the plants then recycle to make more carbohydrates. What amarvelous cooperative arrangement - plants and animals each inhaling the other\u2019sexhalations, a kind of planet-wide mutual mouth-to-stoma resuscitation, the entire elegantcycle powered by a star 1 50 million kilometers away.","113":"There are tens of billions of known kinds of organic molecules. Yet only about fiftyof them are used for the essential activities of life. The same patterns are employed overand over again, conservatively, ingeniously for different functions. And at the very heart of","114":"life on Earth the proteins that control cell chemistry, and the nucleic acids that carry thehereditary instructions - we find these molecules to be essentially identical in all the plantsand animals. An oak tree and I are made of the same stuff. If you go far enough back, wehave a common ancestor.","115":"The living cell is a regime as complex and beautiful as the realm of the galaxies andthe stars. The elaborate machinery of the cell has been painstakingly evolved over fourbillion years. Fragments of food are transmogrified into cellular machinery. Today\u2019s whiteblood cell is yesterday\u2019s creamed spinach. How does the cell do it? Inside is a labyrinthineand subtle architecture that maintains its own structure, transforms molecules, stores energyand prepares for self-replication. If we could enter a cell, many of the molecular specks wewould see would be protein molecules, some in frenzied activity, others merely waiting.","116":"The most important proteins are enzymes, molecules that control the cell\u2019s chemicalreactions. Enzymes are like assembly-line workers, each specializing in a particularmolecular job: Step 4 in the construction of the nucleotide guanosine phosphate, say, orStep 1 1 in the dismantling of a molecule of sugar to extract energy, the currency that paysfor getting the other cellular jobs done. But the enzymes do not run the show. They receivetheir instructions - and are in fact themselves constructed - on orders sent from those incharge. The boss molecules are the nucleic acids. They live sequestered in a forbidden cityin the deep interior, in the nucleus of the cell.","117":"If we plunged through a pore into the nucleus of the cell, we would find somethingthat resembles an explosion in a spaghetti factory - a disorderly multitude of coils andstrands, which are the two kinds of nucleic acids: DNA, which knows what to do, and RNA,which conveys the instructions issued by DNA to the rest of the cell. These are the best thatfour billion years of evolution could produce, containing the full complement ofinformation on how to make a cell, a tree or a human work. The amount of information inhuman DNA, if written out in ordinary language, would occupy a hundred thick volumes.What is more, the DNA molecules know how to make, with only very rare exceptions,identical copies of themselves. They know extraordinarily much.","118":"DNA is a double helix, the two intertwined strands resembling a \u2018spiral\u2019 staircase. Itis the sequence or ordering of the nucleotides along either of the constituent strands that isthe language of life. During reproduction, the helices separate, assisted by a specialunwinding protein, each synthesizing an identical copy of the other from nucleotidebuilding blocks floating about nearby in the viscous liquid of the cell nucleus. Once theunwinding is underway, a remarkable enzyme called DNA polymerase helps ensure that thecopying works almost perfectly. If a mistake is made, there are enzymes which snip themistake out and replace the wrong nucleotide by the right one. These enzymes are amolecular machine with awesome powers.","119":"In addition to making accurate copies of itself - which is what heredity is about -nuclear DNA directs the activities of the cell - which is what metabolism is about - bysynthesizing another nucleic acid called messenger RNA, each of which passes to theextranuclear provinces and there controls the construction, at the right time, in the rightplace, of one enzyme. When all is done, a single enzyme molecule has been produced,which then goes about ordering one particular aspect of the chemistry of the cell.","120":"Human DNA is a ladder a billion nucleotides long. Most possible combinations of","121":"nucleotides are nonsense: they would cause the synthesis of proteins that perform no usefulfunction. Only an extremely limited number of nucleic acid molecules are any good forlifeforms as complicated as we. Even so, the number of useful ways of putting nucleic acidstogether is stupefyingly large - probably far greater than the total number of electrons andprotons in the universe. Accordingly, the number of possible individual human beings isvastly greater than the number that have ever lived: the untapped potential of the humanspecies is immense. There must be ways of putting nucleic acids together that will functionfar better - by any criterion we choose - than any human being who has ever lived.Fortunately, we do not yet know how to assemble alternative sequences of nucleotides tomake alternative kinds of human beings. In the future we may well be able to assemblenucleotides in any desired sequence, to produce whatever characteristics we think desirable","122":"- a sobering and disquieting prospect.","123":"Evolution works through mutation and selection. Mutations might occur duringreplication if the enzyme DNA polymerase makes a mistake. But it rarely makes a mistake.Mutations also occur because of radioactivity or ultraviolet light from the Sun or cosmicrays or chemicals in the environment, all of which can change the nucleotides or tie thenucleic acids up in knots. If the mutation rate is too high, we lose the inheritance of fourbillion years of painstaking evolution. If it is too low, new varieties will not be available toadapt to some future change in the environment. The evolution of life requires a more orless precise balance between mutation and selection. When that balance is achieved,remarkable adaptations occur.","124":"A change in a single DNA nucleotide causes a change in a single amino acid in theprotein for which that DNA codes. The red blood cells of people of European descent lookroughly globular. The red blood cells of some people of African descent look like sickles orcrescent moons. Sickle cells carry less oxygen and consequently transmit a kind of anemia.They also provide major resistance against malaria. There is no question that it is better tobe anemic than to be dead. This major influence on the function of the blood - so striking asto be readily apparent in photographs of red blood cells - is the result of a change in a singlenucleotide out of the ten billion in the DNA of a typical human cell. We are still ignorant ofthe consequences of changes in most of the other nucleotides.","125":"We humans look rather different than a tree. Without a doubt we perceive the worlddifferently than a tree does. But down deep, at the molecular heart of life, the trees and weare essentially identical. We both use nucleic acids for heredity; we both use proteins asenzymes to control the chemistry of our cells. Most significantly, we both use precisely thesame code book for translating nucleic acid information into protein information, as dovirtually all the other creatures on the planet.* The usual explanation of this molecularunity is that we are, all of us - trees and people, angler fish and slime molds and paramecia","126":"- descended from a single and common instance of the origin of life in the early history ofour planet. How did the critical molecules then arise?","127":"* The genetic code turns out to be not quite identical in all parts of all organisms on the Earth. Atleast a few cases are known where the transcription from DNA information into protein information in amitochondrion employs a different code book from that used by the genes in the nucleus of the very same cell.This points to a long evolutionary separation of the genetic codes of mitochondria and nuclei, and is","128":"consistent with the idea that mitochondria were once free-living organisms incorporated into the cell in asymbiotic relationship billions of years ago. The development and emerging sophistication of that symbiosisis, incidentally, one answer to the question of what evolution was doing between the origin of the cell and theproliferation of many-celled organisms in the Cambrian explosion.","129":"In my laboratory at Cornell University we work on, among other things,prebiological organic chemistry, making some notes of the music of life. We mix togetherand spark the gases of the primitive Earth: hydrogen, water, ammonia, methane, hydrogensulfide - all present, incidentally, on the planet Jupiter today and throughout the Cosmos.","130":"The sparks correspond to lightning - also present on the ancient Earth and on modernJupiter. The reaction vessel is initially transparent: the precursor gases are entirely invisible.But after ten minutes of sparking, we see a strange brown pigment slowly streaking thesides of the vessel. The interior gradually becomes opaque, covered with a thick brown tar.","131":"If we had used ultraviolet light - simulating the early Sun - the results would have beenmore or less the same. The tar is an extremely rich collection of complex organic molecules,including the constituent parts of proteins and nucleic acids. The stuff of life, it turns out,can be very easily made.","132":"Such experiments were first performed in the early 1950\u2019s by Stanley Miller, then agraduate student of the chemist Harold Urey. Urey had argued compellingly that the earlyatmosphere of the Earth was hydrogen-rich, as is most of the Cosmos; that the hydrogenhas since trickled away to space from Earth, but not from massive Jupiter; and that theorigin of life occurred before the hydrogen was lost. After Urey suggested that such gasesbe sparked, someone asked him what he expected to make in such an experiment. Ureyreplied, \u2018 Beilstein .\u2019 Beil stein is the massive German compendium in 28 volumes, listing allthe organic molecules known to chemists.","133":"Using only the most abundant gases that were present on the early Earth and almostany energy source that breaks chemical bonds, we can produce the essential building blocksof life. But in our vessel are only the notes of the music of life - not the music itself. Themolecular building blocks must be put together in the correct sequence. Life is certainlymore than the amino acids that make up its proteins and the nucleotides that make up itsnucleic acids. But even in ordering these building blocks into long-chain molecules, therehas been substantial laboratory progress. Amino acids have been assembled under primitiveEarth conditions into molecules resembling proteins. Some of them feebly control usefulchemical reactions, as enzymes do. Nucleotides have been put together into strands ofnucleic acid a few dozen units long. Under the right circumstances in the test tube, shortnucleic acids can synthesize identical copies of themselves.","134":"No one has so far mixed together the gases and waters of the primitive Earth and atthe end of the experiment had something crawl out of the test tube. The smallest livingthings known, the viroids, are composed of less than 10,000 atoms. They cause severaldifferent diseases in cultivated plants and have probably most recently evolved from morecomplex organisms rather than from simpler ones. Indeed, it is hard to imagine a stillsimpler organism that is in any sense alive. Viroids are composed exclusively of nucleicacid, unlike the viruses, which also have a protein coat. They are no more than a singlestrand of RNA with either a linear or a closed circular geometry. Viroids can be so smalland still thrive because they are thoroughgoing, unremitting parasites. Like viruses, theysimply take over the molecular machinery of a much larger, well-functioning cell andchange it from a factory for making more cells into a factory for making more viroids.","135":"The smallest known free-living organisms are the PPLO (pleuropneumonia-likeorganisms) and similar small beasts. They are composed of about fifty million atoms. Suchorganisms, having to be more self-reliant, are also more complicated than viroids andviruses. But the environment of the Earth today is not extremely favorable for simple formsof life. You have to work hard to make a living. You have to be careful about predators. Inthe early history of our planet, however, when enormous amounts of organic moleculeswere being produced by sunlight in a hydrogen-rich atmosphere, very simple, nonparasiticorganisms had a fighting chance. The first living things may have been something likefree-living viroids only a few hundred nucleotides long. Experimental work on makingsuch creatures from scratch may begin by the end of the century. There is still much to beunderstood about the origin of life, including the origin of the genetic code. But we havebeen performing such experiments for only some thirty years. Nature has had afour-billion-year head start. All in all, we have not done badly.","136":"Nothing in such experiments is unique to the Earth. The initial gases, and the energysources, are common throughout the Cosmos. Chemical reactions like those in ourlaboratory vessels may be responsible for the organic matter in interstellar space and theamino acids found in meteorites. Some similar chemistry must have occurred on a billionother worlds in the Milky Way Galaxy. The molecules of life fill the Cosmos.","137":"But even if life on another planet has the same molecular chemistry as life here,there is no reason to expect it to resemble familiar organisms. Consider the enormousdiversity of living things on Earth, all of which share the same planet and an identicalmolecular biology. Those other beasts and vegetables are probably radically different fromany organism we know here. There may be some convergent evolution because there maybe only one best solution to a certain environmental problem - something like two eyes, forexample, for binocular vision at optical frequencies. But in general the random character ofthe evolutionary process should create extraterrestrial creatures very different from any thatwe know.","138":"I cannot tell you what an extraterrestrial being would look like. I am terribly limitedby the fact that I know only one kind of life, life on Earth. Some people - science fictionwriters and artists, for instance - have speculated on what other beings might be like. I amskeptical about most of those extraterrestrial visions. They seem to me to rely too much onforms of life we already know. Any given organism is the way it is because of a long seriesof individually unlikely steps. I do not think life anywhere else would look very much likea reptile, or an insect or a human - even with such minor cosmetic adjustments as greenskin, pointy ears and antennae. But if you pressed me, I could try to imagine somethingrather different.","139":"On a giant gas planet like Jupiter, with an atmosphere rich in hydrogen, helium,methane, water and ammonia, there is no accessible solid surface, but rather a dense cloudyatmosphere in which organic molecules may be falling from the skies like manna fromheaven, like the products of our laboratory experiments. However, there is a characteristicimpediment to life on such a planet: the atmosphere is turbulent, and down deep it is veryhot. An organism must be careful that it is not carried down and fried.","140":"To show that life is not out of the question in such a very different planet, myCornell colleague E. E. Salpeter and I have made some calculations. Of course, we cannotknow precisely what life would be like in such a place, but we wanted to see if, within thelaws of physics and chemistry, a world of this sort could possibly be inhabited.","141":"One way to make a living under these conditions is to reproduce before you arefried and hope that convection will carry some of your offspring to the higher and coolerlayers of the atmosphere. Such organisms could be very little. We call them sinkers. Butyou could also be a floater, some vast hydrogen balloon pumping helium and heavier gasesout of its interior and leaving only the lightest gas, hydrogen; or a hot-air balloon, stayingbuoyant by keeping your interior warm, using energy acquired from the food you eat. Likefamiliar terrestrial balloons, the deeper a floater is carried, the stronger is the buoyant forcereturning it to the higher, cooler, safer regions of the atmosphere. A floater might eatpreformed organic molecules, or make its own from sunlight and air, somewhat as plantsdo on Earth. Up to a point, the bigger a floater is, the more efficient it will be. Salpeter andI imagined floaters kilometers across, enormously larger than the greatest whale that everwas, beings the size of cities.","142":"The floaters may propel themselves through the planetary atmosphere with gusts ofgas, like a ramjet or a rocket. We imagine them arranged in great lazy herds for as far as theeye can see, with patterns on their skin, an adaptive camouflage implying that they haveproblems, too. Because there is at least one other ecological niche in such an environment:hunting. Hunters are fast and maneuverable. They eat the floaters both for their organicmolecules and for their store of pure hydrogen. Hollow sinkers could have evolved into thefirst floaters, and self-propelled floaters into the first hunters. There cannot be very manyhunters, because if they consume all the floaters, the hunters themselves will perish.","143":"Physics and chemistry permit such lifeforms. Art endows them with a certain charm.Nature, however, is not obliged to follow our speculations. But if there are billions ofinhabited worlds in the Milky Way Galaxy, perhaps there will be a few populated by thesinkers, floaters and hunters which our imaginations, tempered by the laws of physics andchemistry, have generated.","144":"Biology is more like history than it is like physics. You have to know the past tounderstand the present. And you have to know it in exquisite detail. There is as yet nopredictive theory of biology, just as there is not yet a predictive theory of history. Thereasons are the same: both subjects are still too complicated for us. But we can knowourselves better by understanding other cases. The study of a single instance ofextraterrestrial life, no matter how humble, will deprovincialize biology. For the first time,the biologists will know what other kinds of life are possible. When we say the search forlife elsewhere is important, we are not guaranteeing that it will be easy to find - only that itis very much worth seeking.","145":"We have heard so far the voice of life on one small world only. But we have at lastbegun to listen for other voices in the cosmic fugue.","146":"The Harmony of Worlds","147":"Do you know the ordinances of the heavens?","148":"Can you establish their rule on Earth?","149":"- The Book of Job","150":"All welfare and adversity that come to man and other creatures come through theSeven and the Twelve. Twelve Signs of the Zodiac, as the Religion says, are thetwelve commanders on the side of light; and the seven planets are said to be theseven commanders on the side of darkness. And the seven planets oppress allcreation and deliver it over to death and all manner of evil: for the twelve signs ofthe Zodiac and the seven planets rule the fate of the world.","151":"- The late Zoroastrian book, the Menok i Xrat","152":"To tell us that every species of thing is endowed with an occult specific quality bywhich it acts and produces manifest effects, is to tell us nothing; but to derive two orthree general principles of motion from phenomena, and afterwards to tell us howthe properties and actions of all corporeal things follow from those manifestprinciples, would be a very great step.","153":"- Isaac Newton, Optics","154":"We do not ask for what useful purpose the birds do sing, for song is their pleasuresince they were created for singing. Similarly, we ought not to ask why the humanmind troubles to fathom the secrets of the heavens . . . The diversity of thephenomena of Nature is so great, and the treasures hidden in the heavens so rich,precisely in order that the human mind shall never be lacking in fresh nourishment.","155":"- Johannes Kepler, Mysterium Cosmographicum","156":"If we lived on a planet where nothing ever changed, there would be little to do. Therewould be nothing to figure out. There would be no impetus for science. And if we lived inan unpredictable world, where things changed in random or very complex ways, we wouldnot be able to figure things out. Again, there would be no such thing as science. But we livein an in-between universe, where things change, but according to patterns, rules, or, as wecall them, laws of nature. If I throw a stick up in the air, it always falls down. If the sun setsin the west, it always rises again the next morning in the east. And so it becomes possible tofigure things out. We can do science, and with it we can improve our lives.","157":"Human beings are good at understanding the world. We always have been. We wereable to hunt game or build fires only because we had figured something out. There was atime before television, before motion pictures, before radio, before books. The greatest partof human existence was spent in such a time. Over the dying embers of the campfire, on amoonless night, we watched the stars.","158":"The night sky is interesting. There are patterns there. Without even trying, you canimagine pictures. In the northern sky, for example, there is a pattern, or constellation, thatlooks a little ursine. Some cultures call it the Great Bear. Others see quite different images.These pictures are not, of course, really in the night sky; we put them there ourselves. Wewere hunter folk, and we saw hunters and dogs, bears and young women, all manner ofthings of interest to us. When seventeenth-century European sailors first saw the southernskies they put objects of seventeenth century interest in the heavens - toucans and peacocks,telescopes and microscopes, compasses and the sterns of ships. If the constellations hadbeen named in the twentieth century, I suppose we would see bicycles and refrigerators inthe sky, rock-and-roll \u2018stars\u2019 and perhaps even mushroom clouds - a new set of humanhopes and fears placed among the stars.","159":"Occasionally our ancestors would see a very bright star with a tail, glimpsed for justa moment, hurtling across the sky. They called it a falling star, but it is not a good name:the old stars are still there after the falling star falls. In some seasons there are many fallingstars; in others very few. There is a kind of regularity here as well.","160":"Like the Sun and the Moon, stars always rise in the east and set in the west, takingthe whole night to cross the sky if they pass overhead. There are different constellations indifferent seasons. The same constellations always rise at the beginning of autumn, say. Itnever happens that a new constellation suddenly rises out of the east. There is an order, apredictability, a permanence about the stars. In a way, they are almost comforting.","161":"Certain stars rise just before or set just after the Sun - and at times and positions thatvary with the seasons. If you made careful observations of the stars and recorded them overmany years, you could predict the seasons. You could also measure the time of year bynoting where on the horizon the Sun rose each day. In the skies was a great calendar,available to anyone with dedication and ability and the means to keep records.","162":"Our ancestors built devices to measure the passing of the seasons. In Chaco Canyon,in New Mexico, there is a great roofless ceremonial kiva or temple, dating from theeleventh century. On June 21, the longest day of the year, a shaft of sunlight enters awindow at dawn and slowly moves so that it covers a special niche. But this happens onlyaround June 21. 1 imagine the proud Anasazi people, who described themselves as \u2018TheAncient Ones,\u2019 gathered in their pews every June 21, dressed in feathers and rattles andturquoise to celebrate the power of the Sun. They also monitored the apparent motion of theMoon: the twenty-eight higher niches in the kiva may represent the number of days for theMoon to return to the same position among the constellations. These people paid closeattention to the Sun and the Moon and the stars. Other devices based on similar ideas arefound at Angkor Wat in Cambodia; Stonehenge in England; Abu Simbel in Egypt; ChichenItza in Mexico; and the Great Plains in North America.","163":"Some alleged calendrical devices may just possibly be due to chance - an accidentalalignment of window and niche on June 21, say. But there are other devices wonderfullydifferent. At one locale in the American Southwest is a set of three upright slabs whichwere moved from their original position about 1,000 years ago. A spiral a little like agalaxy has been carved in the rock. On June 21, the first day of summer, a dagger ofsunlight pouring through an opening between the slabs bisects the spiral; and on December21, the first day of winter, there are two daggers of sunlight that flank the spiral, a unique","164":"application of the midday sun to read the calendar in the sky.","165":"Why did people all over the world make such an effort to learn astronomy? Wehunted gazelles and antelope and buffalo whose migrations ebbed and flowed with theseasons. Fruits and nuts were ready to be picked in some times but not in others. When weinvented agriculture, we had to take care to plant and harvest our crops in the right season.Annual meetings of far-flung nomadic tribes were set for prescribed times. The ability toread the calendar in the skies was literally a matter of life and death. The reappearance ofthe crescent moon after the new moon; the return of the Sun after a total eclipse; the risingof the Sun in the morning after its troublesome absence at night were noted by peoplearound the world: these phenomena spoke to our ancestors of the possibility of survivingdeath. Up there in the skies was also a metaphor of immortality.","166":"The wind whips through the canyons in the American Southwest, and there is noone to hear it but us - a reminder of the 40,000 generations of thinking men and womenwho preceded us, about whom we know almost nothing, upon whom our civilization isbased.","167":"As ages passed, people learned from their ancestors. The more accurately you knewthe position and movements of the Sun and Moon and stars, the more reliably you couldpredict when to hunt, when to sow and reap, when to gather the tribes. As precision ofmeasurement improved, records had to be kept, so astronomy encouraged observation andmathematics and the development of writing.","168":"But then, much later, another rather curious idea arose, an assault by mysticism andsuperstition into what had been largely an empirical science. The Sun and stars controlledthe seasons, food, warmth. The Moon controlled the tides, the life cycles of many animals,and perhaps the human menstrual* period - of central importance for a passionate speciesdevoted to having children. There was another kind of object in the sky, the wandering orvagabond stars called planets. Our nomadic ancestors must have felt an affinity for theplanets. Not counting the Sun and the Moon, you could see only five of them. They movedagainst the background of more distant stars. If you followed their apparent motion overmany months, they would leave one constellation, enter another, occasionally even do akind of slow loop-the-loop in the sky. Everything else in the sky had some real effect onhuman life. What must the influence of the planets be?","169":"* The root of the word means \u2018Moon.\u2019","170":"In contemporary Western society, buying a magazine on astrology - at a newsstand,say - is easy; it is much harder to find one on astronomy. Virtually every newspaper inAmerica has a daily column on astrology; there are hardly any that have even a weeklycolumn on astronomy. There are ten times more astrologers in the United States thanastronomers. At parties, when I meet people who do not know I am a scientist, I amsometimes asked, \u2018Are you a Gemini?\u2019 (chances of success, one in twelve), or \u2018What signare you?\u2019 Much more rarely am I asked, \u2018Have you heard that gold is made in supernovaexplosions?\u2019 or \u2018When do you think Congress will approve a Mars Rover?\u2019","171":"Astrology contends that which constellation the planets are in at the moment of yourbirth profoundly influences your future. A few thousand years ago, the idea developed that","172":"the motions of the planets determined the fates of kings, dynasties, empires. Astrologersstudied the motions of the planets and asked themselves what had happened the last timethat, say, Venus was rising in the Constellation of the Goat; perhaps something similarwould happen this time as well. It was a subtle and risky business. Astrologers came to beemployed only by the State. In many countries it was a capital offense for anyone but theofficial astrologer to read the portents in the skies: a good way to overthrow a regime wasto predict its downfall. Chinese court astrologers who made inaccurate predictions wereexecuted. Others simply doctored the records so that afterwards they were in perfectconformity with events. Astrology developed into a strange combination of observations,mathematics and careful record-keeping with fuzzy thinking and pious fraud.","173":"But if the planets could determine the destinies of nations, how could they avoidinfluencing what will happen to me tomorrow? The notion of a personal astrologydeveloped in Alexandrian Egypt and spread through the Greek and Roman worlds about2,000 years ago. We today can recognize the antiquity of astrology in words such asdisaster , which is Greek for \u2018bad star,\u2019 influenza, Italian for (astral) \u2018influence\u2019; mazeltov,Hebrew - and, ultimately, Babylonian - for \u2018good constellation,\u2019 or the Yiddish wordshlamazel, applied to someone plagued by relentless ill-fortune, which again traces to theBabylonian astronomical lexicon. According to Pliny, there were Romans consideredsideratio, \u2018planets truck.\u2019 Planets were widely thought to be a direct cause of death. Orconsider consider, it means \u2018with the planets,\u2019 evidently the prerequisite for seriousreflection. John Graunt compiled the mortality statistics in the City of London in 1632.Among the terrible losses from infant and childhood diseases and such exotic illnesses as\u2018the rising of the lights\u2019 and \u2018the King\u2019s evil,\u2019 we find that, of 9,535 deaths, 13 peoplesuccumbed to \u2018planet,\u2019 more than died of cancer. I wonder what the symptoms were.","174":"And personal astrology is with us still: consider two different newspaper astrologycolumns published in the same city on the same day. For example, we can examine theNew York Post and the New York Daily News on September 21, 1979. Suppose you are aLibra - that is, born between September 23 and October 22. According to the astrologer forthe Post, \u2018a compromise will help ease tension\u2019; useful, perhaps, but somewhat vague.According to the Daily News\u2019s astrologer, you must \u2018demand more of yourself,\u2019 anadmonition that is also vague but also different. These \u2018predictions\u2019 are not predictions;rather they are pieces of advice - they tell what to do, not what will happen. Deliberately,they are phrased so generally that they could apply to anyone. And they display majormutual inconsistencies. Why are they published as unapologetically as sports statistics andstock market reports?","175":"Astrology can be tested by the lives of twins. There are many cases in which onetwin is killed in childhood, in a riding accident, say, or is struck by lightning, while theother lives to a prosperous old age. Each was born in precisely the same place and withinminutes of the other. Exactly the same planets were rising at their births. If astrology werevalid, how could two such twins have such profoundly different fates? It also turns out thatastrologers cannot even agree among themselves on what a given horoscope means. Incareful tests, they are unable to predict the character and future of people they knewnothing about except their time and place of birth.*","176":"* Skepticism about astrology and related doctrines is neither new nor exclusive to the West. Forexample, in the Essays on Idleness, written in 1332 by Tsurezuregusa Kenko, we read:","177":"The Yin-Yang teachings (in Japan] have nothing to say on the subject of the Red Tongue Days.Formerly people did not avoid these days, but of late - 1 wonder who is responsible for starting thiscustom - people have taken to saying things such as, \u2018An enterprise begun on a Red Tongue Day willnever see an end,\u2019 or, \u2018Anything you say or do on a Red Tongue Day is bound to come to naught:you lose what you\u2019ve won, your plans are undone.\u2019 What nonsense! If one counted the projectsbegun on carefully selected \u2018lucky days\u2019 which came to nothing in the end, they would probably bequite as many as the fruitless enterprises begun on the Red Tongue days.","178":"There is something curious about the national flags of the planet Earth. The flag ofthe United States has fifty stars; the Soviet Union and Israel, one each; Burma, fourteen;Grenada and Venezuela, seven; China, five; Iraq, three; Sao Tome a Principe, two; Japan,Uruguay, Malawi, Bangladesh and Taiwan, the Sun; Brazil, a celestial sphere; Australia,Western Samoa, New Zealand and Papua New Guinea, the constellation of the SouthernCross; Bhutan, the dragon pearl, symbol of the Earth; Cambodia, the Angkor Watastronomical observatory; India, South Korea and the Mongolian Peoples\u2019 Republic,cosmological symbols. Many socialist nations display stars. Many Islamic countries displaycrescent moons. Almost half of our national flags exhibit astronomical symbols. Thephenomenon is transcultural, non-sectarian, worldwide. It is also not restricted to our time:Sumerian cylinder seals from the third millennium B.C. and Taoist flags inprerevolutionary China displayed constellations. Nations, I do not doubt, wish to embracesomething of the power and credibility of the heavens. We seek a connection with theCosmos. We want to count in the grand scale of things. And it turns out we are connected -not in the personal, small-scale unimaginative fashion that the astrologers pretend, but inthe deepest ways, involving the origin of matter, the habitability of the Earth, the evolutionand destiny of the human species, themes to which we will return.","179":"Modern popular astrology runs directly back to Claudius Ptolemaeus, whom we callPtolemy, although he was unrelated to the kings of the same name. He worked in theLibrary of Alexandria in the second century. All that arcane business about planetsascendant in this or that solar or lunar \u2018house\u2019 or the \u2018Age of Aquarius\u2019 comes fromPtolemy, who codified the Babylonian astrological tradition. Here is a typical horoscopefrom Ptolemy\u2019s time, written in Greek on papyrus, for a little girl born in the year 150: \u2018Thebirth of Philoe. The 10th year of Antoninus Caesar the lord, Phamenoth 15 to 16, first hourof the night. Sun in Pisces, Jupiter and Mercury in Aries, Saturn in Cancer, Mars in Leo,Venus and the Moon in Aquarius, horoscopus Capricorn.\u2019 The method of enumerating themonths and the years has changed much more over the intervening centuries than have theastrological niceties. A typical excerpt from Ptolemy\u2019s astrological book, the Tetrabiblos,reads: \u2018Saturn, if he is in the orient, makes his subjects in appearance dark-skinned, robust,black-haired, curly-haired, hairy-chested, with eyes of moderate size, of middling stature,and in temperament having an excess of the moist and cold.\u2019 Ptolemy believed not only thatbehavior patterns were influenced by the planet\u2019s and the stars but also that questions ofstature, complexion, national character and even congenital physical abnormalities weredetermined by the stars. On this point modern astrologers seem to have adopted a morecautious position.","180":"But modern astrologers have forgotten about the precession of the equinoxes, whichPtolemy understood. They ignore atmospheric refraction, about which Ptolemy wrote. Theypay almost no attention to all the moons and planets, asteroids and comets, quasars andpulsars, exploding galaxies, symbiotic stars, cataclysmic variables and X-ray sources thathave been discovered since Ptolemy\u2019s time. Astronomy is a science - the study of theuniverse as it is. Astrology is a pseudoscience - a claim, in the absence of good evidence,that the other planets affect our everyday lives. In Ptolemy\u2019s time the distinction betweenastronomy and astrology was not clear. Today it is.","181":"As an astronomer, Ptolemy named the stars, listed their brightnesses, gave goodreasons for believing that the Earth is a sphere, set down rules for predicting eclipses and,perhaps most important, tried to understand why planets exhibit that strange, wanderingmotion against the background of distant constellations. He developed a predictive modelto understand planetary motions and decode the message in the skies. The study of theheavens brought Ptolemy a kind of ecstasy. \u2018Mortal as I am,\u2019 he wrote, \u2018I know that I amborn for a day. But when I follow at my pleasure the serried multitude of the stars in theircircular course, my feet no longer touch the Earth. . .\u2019","182":"Ptolemy believed that the Earth was at the center of the universe; that the Sun,Moon, planets and stars went around the Earth. This is the most natural idea in the world.The Earth seems steady, solid, immobile, while we can see the heavenly bodies rising andsetting each day. Every culture has leaped to the geocentric hypothesis. As Johannes Keplerwrote, \u2018It is therefore impossible that reason not previously instructed should imagineanything other than that the Earth is a kind of vast house with the vault of the sky placed ontop of it; it is motionless and within it the Sun being so small passes from one region toanother, like a bird wandering through the air.\u2019 But how do we explain the apparent motionof the planets - Mars, for example, which had been known for thousands of years beforePtolemy\u2019s time? (One of the epithets given Mars by the ancient Egyptians was sekded-efem khetkhet, which means \u2018who travels backwards,\u2019 a clear reference to its retrograde orloop-the-loop apparent motion.)","183":"Ptolemy\u2019s model of planetary motion can be represented by a little machine, likethose that, serving a similar purpose, existed in Ptolemy\u2019s time.* The problem was to figureout a \u2018real\u2019 motion of the planets, as seen from up there, on the \u2018outside,\u2019 which wouldreproduce with great accuracy the apparent motion of the planets, as seen from down here,on the \u2018inside.\u2019","184":"* Four centuries earlier, such a device was constructed by Archimedes and examined and describedby Cicero in Rome, where it had been carried by the Roman general Marcellus, one of whose soldiers had,gratuitously and against orders, killed the septuagenarian scientist during the conquest of Syracuse.","185":"The planets were imagined to go around the Earth affixed to perfect transparentspheres. But they were not attached directly to the spheres, but indirectly, through a kind ofoff-center wheel. The sphere turns, the little wheel rotates, and, as seen from the Earth,","186":"Mars does its loop-the-loop. This model permitted reasonably accurate predictions ofplanetary motion, certainly good enough for the precision of measurement available inPtolemy\u2019s day, and even many centuries later.","187":"Ptolemy\u2019s aetherial spheres, imagined in medieval times to be made of crystal, arewhy we still talk about the music of the spheres and a seventh heaven (there was a\u2018heaven,\u2019 or sphere for the Moon, Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, andone more for the stars). With the Earth the center of the Universe, with creation pivotedabout terrestrial events, with the heavens imagined constructed on utterly unearthlyprinciples, there was little motivation for astronomical observations. Supported by theChurch through the Dark Ages, Ptolemy\u2019s model helped prevent the advance of astronomyfor a millennium. Finally, in 1543, a quite different hypothesis to explain the apparentmotion of the planets was published by a Polish Catholic cleric named Nicholas CopernicusIts most daring feature was the proposition that the Sun, not the Earth, was at the center ofthe universe. The Earth was demoted to just one of the planets, third from the Sun, movingin a perfect circular orbit. (Ptolemy had considered such a heliocentric model but rejected itimmediately; from the physics of Aristotle, the implied violent rotation of the Earth seemedcontrary to observation.)","188":"It worked at least as well as Ptolemy\u2019s spheres in explaining the apparent motion ofthe planets. But it annoyed many people. In 1616 the Catholic Church placed Copernicus\u2019work on its list of forbidden books \u2018until corrected\u2019 by local ecclesiastical censors, where itremained until 1835.* Martin Luther described him as \u2018an upstart astrologer . . . This foolwishes to reverse the entire science of astronomy. But Sacred Scripture tells us that Joshuacommanded the Sun to stand still, and not the Earth.\u2019 Even some of Copernicus\u2019 admirersargued that he had not really believed in a Sun-centered universe but had merely proposedit as a convenience for calculating the motions of the planets.","189":"* In a recent inventory of nearly every sixteenth-century copy of Copernicus\u2019 book, Owen Gingerichhas found the censorship to have been ineffective: only 60 percent of the copies in Italy were \u2018corrected,\u2019 andnot one in Iberia.","190":"The epochal confrontation between the two views of the Cosmos - Earth-centeredand Sun-centered - reached a climax in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries in theperson of a man who was, like Ptolemy, both astrologer and astronomer. He lived in a timewhen the human spirit was fettered and the mind chained; when the ecclesiasticalpronouncements of a millennium or two earlier on scientific matters were considered morereliable than contemporary findings made with techniques unavailable to the ancients;when deviations, even on arcane theological matters, from the prevailing doxologicalpreferences, Catholic or Protestant, were punished by humiliation, taxation, exile, torture ordeath. The heavens were inhabited by angels, demons and the Hand of God, turning theplanetary crystal spheres. Science was barren of the idea that underlying the phenomena ofNature might be the laws of physics. But the brave and lonely struggle of this man was toignite the modern scientific revolution.","191":"Johannes Kepler was born in Germany in 1571 and sent as a boy to the Protestantseminary school in the provincial town of Maulbronn to be educated for the clergy. It was akind of boot camp, training young minds in the use of theological weaponry against thefortress of Roman Catholicism. Kepler, stubborn, intelligent and fiercely independent,suffered two friendless years in bleak Maulbronn, becoming isolated and withdrawn, histhoughts devoted to his imagined unworthiness in the eyes of God. He repented a thousandsins no more wicked than another\u2019s and despaired of ever attaining salvation.","192":"But God became for him more than a divine wrath craving propitiation. Kepler\u2019s God wasthe creative power of the Cosmos. The boy\u2019s curiosity conquered his fear. He wished tolearn the eschatology of the world; he dared to contemplate the Mind of God. Thesedangerous visions, at first insubstantial as a memory, became a lifelong obsession. Thehubristic longings of a child seminarian were to carry Europe out of the cloister of medievalthought.","193":"The sciences of classical antiquity had been silenced more than a thousand yearsbefore, but in the late Middle Ages some faint echoes of those voices, preserved by Arabscholars, began to insinuate themselves into the European educational curriculum. InMaulbronn, Kepler heard their reverberations, studying, besides theology, Greek and Latin,music and mathematics. In the geometry of Euclid he thought he glimpsed an image ofperfection and cosmic glory. He was later to write: \u2018Geometry existed before the Creation.","194":"It is co-eternal with the mind of God . . . Geometry provided God with a model for theCreation . . . Geometry is God Himself.\u2019","195":"In the midst of Kepler\u2019s mathematical raptures, and despite his sequestered life, theimperfections of the outside world must also have molded his character. Superstition was awidely available nostrum for people powerless against the miseries of famine, pestilenceand deadly doctrinal conflict. For many, the only certainty was the stars, and the ancientastrological conceit prospered in the courtyards and taverns of fear-haunted Europe. Kepler,whose attitude toward astrology remained ambiguous all his life, wondered whether theremight be hidden patterns underlying the apparent chaos of daily life. If the world wascrafted by God, should it not be examined closely? Was not all of creation an expression ofthe harmonies in the mind of God? The book of Nature had waited more than a millenniumfor a reader.","196":"In 1589, Kepler left Maulbronn to study for the clergy at the great university inTubingen and found it a liberation. Confronted by the most vital intellectual currents of thetime, his genius was immediately recognized by his teachers - one of whom introduced theyoung man to the dangerous mysteries of the Copernican hypothesis. A heliocentricuniverse resonated with Kepler\u2019s religious sense, and he embraced it with fervor. The Sunwas a metaphor for God, around Whom all else revolves. Before he was to be ordained, hewas made an attractive offer of secular employment, which - perhaps because he felthimself indifferently suited to an ecclesiastical career - he found himself accepting. He wassummoned to Graz, in Austria, to teach secondary school mathematics, and began a littlelater to prepare astronomical and meteorological almanacs and to cast horoscopes. \u2018Godprovides for every animal his means of sustenance,\u2019 he wrote. \u2018For the astronomer, He hasprovided astrology.\u2019","197":"Kepler was a brilliant thinker and a lucid writer, but he was a disaster as aclassroom teacher. He mumbled. He digressed. He was at times utterly incomprehensible.He drew only a handful of students his first year at Graz; the next year there were none. Hewas distracted by an incessant interior clamor of associations and speculations vying for hisattention. And one pleasant summer afternoon, deep in the interstices of one of hisinterminable lectures, he was visited by a revelation that was to alter radically the future of","198":"astronomy. Perhaps he stopped in mid-sentence. His inattentive students, longing for theend of the day, took little notice, I suspect, of the historic moment.","199":"There were only six planets known in Kepler\u2019s time: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars,Jupiter and Saturn. Kepler wondered why only six? Why not twenty, or a hundred? Whydid they have the spacing between their orbits that Copernicus had deduced? No one hadever asked such questions before. There were known to be five regular or \u2018platonic\u2019 solids,whose sides were regular polygons, as known to the ancient Greek mathematicians after thetime of Pythagoras. Kepler thought the two numbers were connected, that the reason therewere only six planets was because there were only five regular solids, and that these solids,inscribed or nested one within another, would specify the distances of the planets from theSun. In these perfect forms, he believed he had recognized the invisible supportingstructures for the spheres of the six planets. He called his revelation The Cosmic Mystery.The connection between the solids of Pythagoras and the disposition of the planets couldadmit but one explanation: the Hand of God, Geometer.","200":"Kepler was amazed that he - immersed, so he thought, in sin - should have beendivinely chosen to make this great discovery. He submitted a proposal for a research grantto the Duke of Wiirttemberg, offering to supervise the construction of his nested solids as athree-dimensional model so that others could glimpse the beauty of the holy geometry. Itmight, he added, be contrived of silver and precious stones and serve incidentally as a ducalchalice. The proposal was rejected with the kindly advice that he first construct a lessexpensive version out of paper, which he promptly attempted to do: \u2018The intense pleasure Ihave received from this discovery can never be told in words ... I shunned no calculationno matter how difficult. Days and nights I spent in mathematical labors, until I could seewhether my hypothesis would agree with the orbits of Copernicus or whether my joy was tovanish into thin air.\u2019 But no matter how hard he tried, the solids and the planetary orbits didnot agree well. The elegance and grandeur of the theory, however, persuaded him that theobservations must be in error, a conclusion drawn when the observations are unobliging bymany other theorists in the history of science. There was then only one man in the worldwho had access to more accurate observations of apparent planetary positions, a self-exiledDanish nobleman who had accepted the post of Imperial Mathematician in the Court of theHoly Roman Emperor, Rudolf II. That man was Tycho Brahe. By chance, at Rudolf\u2019ssuggestion, he had just invited Kepler, whose mathematical fame was growing, to join himin Prague.","201":"A provincial schoolteacher of humble origins, unknown to all but a fewmathematicians, Kepler was diffident about Tycho\u2019s offer. But the decision was made forhim. In 1598, one of the many premonitory tremors of the coming Thirty Years\u2019 Warengulfed him. The local Catholic archduke, steadfast in dogmatic certainty, vowed hewould rather \u2018make a desert of the country than rule over heretics.\u2019* Protestants wereexcluded from economic and political power, Kepler\u2019s school was closed, and prayers,books and hymns deemed heretical were forbidden. Finally the townspeople weresummoned to individual examinations on the soundness of their private religiousconvictions, those refusing to profess the Roman Catholic faith being fined a tenth of theirincome and, upon pain of death, exiled forever from Graz. Kepler chose exile: \u2018Hypocrisy Ihave never learned. I am in earnest about faith. I do not play with it.\u2019","202":"* By no means the most extreme such remark in medieval or Reformation Europe. Upon being askedhow to distinguish the faithful from the infidel in the siege of a largely Albigensian city, Domingo de Guzman,later known as Saint Dominic, allegedly replied: \u2018Kill them all. God will know his own.\u2019","203":"Leaving Graz, Kepler, his wife and stepdaughter set out on the difficult journey toPrague. Theirs was not a happy marriage. Chronically ill, having recently lost two youngchildren, his wife was described as \u2018stupid, sulking, lonely, melancholy.\u2019 She had nounderstanding of her husband\u2019s work and, having been raised among the minor rural gentry,she despised his impecunious profession. He for his part alternately admonished andignored her, \u2018for my studies sometimes made me thoughtless; but I learned my lesson, Ilearned to have patience with her. When I saw that she took my words to heart, I wouldrather have bitten my own finger than to give her further offense. \u2019 But Kepler remainedpreoccupied with his work.","204":"He envisioned Tycho\u2019s domain as a refuge from the evils of the time, as the placewhere his Cosmic Mystery would be confirmed. He aspired to become a colleague of thegreat Tycho Brahe, who for thirty-five years had devoted himself, before the invention ofthe telescope, to the measurement of a clockwork universe, ordered and precise. Kepler\u2019sexpectations were to be unfulfilled. Tycho himself was a flamboyant figure, festooned witha golden nose, the original having been lost in a student duel fought over who was thesuperior mathematician. Around him was a raucous entourage of assistants, sycophants,distant relatives and assorted hangers-on. Their endless revelry, their innuendoes andintrigues, their cruel mockery of the pious and scholarly country bumpkin depressed andsaddened Kepler: \u2018Tycho ... is superlatively rich but knows not how to make use of it. Anysingle instrument of his costs more than my and my whole family\u2019s fortunes put together.\u2019","205":"Impatient to see Tycho\u2019s astronomical data, Kepler would be thrown only a fewscraps at a time: \u2018Tycho gave me no opportunity to share in his experiences. He would only,in the course of a meal and, in between other matters, mention, as if in passing, today thefigure of the apogee of one planet, tomorrow the nodes of another . . . Tycho posesses thebest observations ... He also has collaborators. He lacks only the architect who would putall this to use.\u2019 Tycho was the greatest observational genius of the age, and Kepler thegreatest theoretician. Each knew that, alone, he would be unable to achieve the synthesis ofan accurate and coherent world system, which they both felt to be imminent. But Tychowas not about to make a gift of his life\u2019s work to a much younger potential rival. Jointauthorship of the results, if any, of the collaboration was for some reason unacceptable. Thebirth of modern science - the offspring of theory and observation - teetered on the precipiceof their mutual mistrust. In the remaining eighteen months that Tycho was to live, the twoquarreled and were reconciled repeatedly. At a dinner given by the Baron of Rosenberg,Tycho, having robustly drunk much wine, \u2018placed civility ahead of health,\u2019 and resisted hisbody\u2019s urgings to leave, even if briefly, before the baron. The consequent urinary infectionworsened when Tycho resolutely rejected advice to temper his eating and drinking. On hisdeathbed, Tycho bequeathed his observations to Kepler, and \u2018on the last night of his gentledelirium, he repeated over and over again these words, like someone composing a poem:\u201cLet me not seem to have lived in vain . . . Let me not seem to have lived in vain.\u201d \u2019","206":"After Tycho\u2019s death, Kepler, now the new Imperial Mathematician, managed toextract the observations from Tycho\u2019s recalcitrant family. His conjecture that the orbits ofthe planets are circumscribed by the five platonic solids was no more supported by Tycho\u2019sdata than by Copernicus\u2019. His \u2018Cosmic Mystery\u2019 was disproved entirely by the much laterdiscoveries of the planets Uranus, Neptune and Pluto - there are no additional platonicsolids* that would determine their distances from the Sun. The nested Pythagorean solidsalso made no allowance for the existence of the Earth\u2019s moon, and Galileo\u2019s discovery ofthe four large moons of Jupiter was also discomfiting. But far from becoming morose,Kepler wished to find additional satellites and wondered how many satellites each planetshould have. He wrote to Galileo: \u2018I immediately began to think how there could be anyaddition to the number of the planets without overturning my Mysterium Cosmographicum,according to which Euclid\u2019s five regular solids do not allow more than six planets aroundthe Sun ... I am so far from disbelieving the existence of the four circumjovial planets thatI long for a telescope, to anticipate you, if possible, in discovering two around Mars, as theproportion seems to require, six or eight round Saturn, and perhaps one each roundMercury and Venus.\u2019 Mars does have two small moons, and a major geological feature onthe larger of them is today called the Kepler Ridge in honor of this guess. But he wasentirely mistaken about Saturn, Mercury and Venus, and Jupiter has many more moonsthan Galileo discovered. We still do not really know why there are only nine planets, moreor less, and why they have the relative distances from the Sun that they do. (See Chapter 8.)","207":"* The proof of this statement can be found in Appendix 2.","208":"Tycho\u2019s observations of the apparent motion of Mars and other planets through theconstellations were made over a period of many years. These data, from the last fewdecades before the telescope was invented, were the most accurate that had yet beenobtained. Kepler worked with a passionate intensity to understand them: What real motionof the Earth and Mars about the Sun could explain, to the precision of measurement, theapparent motion of Mars in the sky, including its retrograde loops through the backgroundconstellations? Tycho had commended Mars to Kepler because its apparent motion seemedmost anomalous, most difficult to reconcile with an orbit made of circles. (To the readerwho might be bored by his many calculations, he later wrote: \u2018If you are wearied by thistedious procedure, take pity on me who carried out at least seventy trials.\u2019)","209":"Pythagoras, in the sixth century B.C., Plato, Ptolemy and all the Christianastronomers before Kepler had assumed that the planets moved in circular paths. The circlewas thought to be a \u2018perfect\u2019 geometrical shape and the planets, placed high in the heavens,away from earthly \u2018corruption,\u2019 were also thought to be in some mystical sense \u2018perfect\u2019Galileo, Tycho and Copernicus were all committed to uniform circular planetary motion,the latter asserting that \u2018the mind shudders\u2019 at the alternative, because \u2018it would beunworthy to suppose such a thing in a Creation constituted in the best possible way.\u2019 So atfirst Kepler tried to explain the observations by imagining that the Earth and Mars movedin circular orbits about the Sun.","210":"After three years of calculation, he believed he had found the correct values for aMartian circular orbit, which matched ten of Tycho\u2019s observations within two minutes of","211":"arc. Now, there are 60 minutes of arc in an angular degree, and 90 degrees, a right angle,from the horizon to the zenith. So a few minutes of arc is a very small quantity to measure -especially without a telescope. It is one-fifteenth the angular diameter of the full Moon asseen from Earth. But Kepler\u2019s replenishable ecstasy soon crumbled into gloom - becausetwo of Tycho\u2019s further observations were inconsistent with Kepler\u2019s orbit, by as much aseight minutes of arc:","212":"Divine Providence granted us such a diligent observer in Tycho Brahe that hisobservations convicted this . . . calculation of an error of eight minutes; it is onlyright that we should accept God\u2019s gift with a grateful mind ... If I had believed thatwe could ignore these eight minutes, I would have patched up my hypothesisaccordingly. But, since it was not permissible to ignore, those eight minutes pointedthe road to a complete reformation in astronomy.","213":"The difference between a circular orbit and the true orbit could be distinguishedonly by precise measurement and a courageous acceptance of the facts: \u2018The universe isstamped with the adornment of harmonic proportions, but harmonies must accommodateexperience.\u2019 Kepler was shaken at being compelled to abandon a circular orbit and toquestion his faith in the Divine Geometer. Having cleared the stable of astronomy of circlesand spirals, he was left, he said, with \u2018only a single cartful of dung,\u2019 a stretched-out circlesomething like an oval.","214":"Eventually, Kepler came to feel that his fascination with the circle had been adelusion. The Earth was a planet, as Copernicus had said, and it was entirely obvious toKepler that the Earth, wracked by wars, pestilence, famine and unhappiness, fell short ofperfection. Kepler was one of the first people since antiquity to propose that the planetswere material objects made of imperfect stuff like the Earth. And if planets were\u2018imperfect,\u2019 why not their orbits as well? He tried various oval-like curves, calculated away,made some arithmetical mistakes (which caused him at first to reject the correct answer)and months later in some desperation tried the formula for an ellipse, first codified in theAlexandrian Library by Apollonius of Perga. He found that it matched Tycho\u2019sobservations beautifully: \u2018The truth of nature, which I had rejected and chased away,returned by stealth through the back door, disguising itself to be accepted . . . Ah, what afoolish bird I have been!\u2019","215":"Kepler had found that Mars moves about the Sun not in a circle, but in an ellipse.","216":"The other planets have orbits much less elliptical than that of Mars, and if Tycho had urgedhim to study the motion of, say, Venus, Kepler might never have discovered the true orbitsof the planets. In such an orbit the Sun is not at the center but is offset, at the focus of theellipse. When a given planet is at its nearest to the Sun, it speeds up. When it is at itsfarthest, it slows down. Such motion is why we describe the planets as forever fallingtoward, but never reaching, the Sun. Kepler\u2019s first law of planetary motion is simply this: Aplanet moves in an ellipse with the Sun at one focus.","217":"In uniform circular motion, an equal angle or fraction of the arc of a circle iscovered in equal times. So, for example, it takes twice as long to go two-thirds of the way","218":"around a circle as it does to go one-third of the way around. Kepler found somethingdifferent for elliptical orbits: As the planet moves along its orbit, it sweeps out a littlewedge-shaped area within the ellipse. When it is close to the Sun, in a given period of timeit traces out a large arc in its orbit, but the area represented by that arc is not very largebecause the planet is then near the Sun. When the planet is far from the Sun, it covers amuch smaller arc in the same period of time, but that arc corresponds to a bigger areabecause the Sun is now more distant. Kepler found that these two areas were precisely thesame no matter how elliptical the orbit: the long skinny area, corresponding to the planetfar from the Sun, and the shorter, squatter area, when the planet is close to the Sun, areexactly equal. This was Kepler\u2019s second law of planetary motion: Planets sweep out equalareas in equal times.","219":"Kepler\u2019s first two laws may seem a little remote and abstract: planets move inellipses, and sweep out equal areas in equal times. Well, so what? Circular motion is easierto grasp. We might have a tendency to dismiss these laws as mere mathematical tinkering,something removed from everyday life. But these are the laws our planet obeys as weourselves, glued by gravity to the surface of the Earth, hurtle through interplanetary space.We move in accord with laws of nature that Kepler first discovered. When we sendspacecraft to the planets, when we observe double stars, when we examine the motion ofdistant galaxies; we find that throughout the universe Kepler\u2019s laws are obeyed.","220":"Many years later, Kepler came upon his third and last law of planetary motion, alaw that relates the motion of various planets to one another, that lays out correctly theclockwork of the solar system. He described it in a book called The Harmonies of theWorld. Kepler understood many things by the word harmony: the order and beauty ofplanetary motion, the existence of mathematical laws explaining that motion - an idea thatgoes back to Pythagoras - and even harmony in the musical sense, the \u2018harmony of thespheres.\u2019 Unlike the orbits of Mercury and Mars, the orbits of other planets depart so littlefrom circularity that we cannot make out their true shapes even in an extremely accuratediagram. The Earth is our moving platform from which we observe the motion of the otherplanets against the backdrop of distant constellations. The inner planets move rapidly intheir orbits - that is why Mercury has the name it does: Mercury was the messenger of thegods. Venus, Earth and Mars move progressively less rapidly about the Sun. The outerplanets, such as Jupiter and Saturn, move stately and slow, as befits the kings of the gods.","221":"Kepler\u2019s third or harmonic law states that the squares of the periods of the planets(the times for them to complete one orbit) are proportional to the cubes of their averagedistance from the Sun; the more distant the planet, the more slowly it moves, but accordingto a precise mathematical law: P A = a , where P represents the period of revolution of theplanet about the Sun, measured in years, and a the distance of the planet from the Sunmeasured in \u2018astronomical units.\u2019 An astronomical unit is the distance of the Earth from theSun. Jupiter, for example, is five astronomical units from the Sun, and a =5x5x5 =125.What number times itself equals 125? Why, 11, close enough. And 11 years is the periodfor Jupiter to go once around the Sun. A similar argument applies for every planet andasteroid and comet. Not content merely to have extracted from Nature the laws of planetarymotion, Kepler endeavored to find some still more fundamental underlying cause, someinfluence of the Sun on the kinematics of worlds. The planets sped up on approaching the","222":"Sun and slowed down on retreating from it. Somehow the distant planets sensed the Sun\u2019spresence. Magnetism also was an influence felt at a distance, and in a stunning anticipationof the idea of universal gravitation, Kepler suggested that the underlying cause was akin tomagnetism:","223":"My aim in this is to show that the celestial machine is to be likened not to a divineorganism but rather to a clockwork . . . , insofar as nearly all the manifoldmovements are carried out by means of a single, quite simple magnetic force, as inthe case of a clockwork [where] all motions [are caused] by a simple weight.","224":"Magnetism is, of course, not the same as gravity, but Kepler\u2019s fundamentalinnovation here is nothing short of breathtaking: he proposed that quantitative physicallaws that apply to the Earth are also the underpinnings of quantitative physical laws thatgovern the heavens. It was the first nonmystical explanation of motion in the heavens; itmade the Earth a province of the Cosmos. \u2018Astronomy,\u2019 he said \u2018is part of physics.\u2019 Keplerstood at a cusp in history; the last scientific astrologer was the first astrophysicist.","225":"Not given to quiet understatement, Kepler assessed his discoveries in these words:","226":"With this symphony of voices man can play through the eternity of time in less thanan hour, and can taste in small measure the delight of God, the Supreme Artist ... Iyield freely to the sacred frenzy . . . the die is cast, and I am writing the book - to beread either now or by posterity, it matters not. It can wait a century for a reader, asGod Himself has waited 6,000 years for a witness.","227":"Within the \u2018symphony of voices,\u2019 Kepler believed that the speed of each planet correspondsto certain notes in the Latinate musical scale popular in his day - do, re, mi, fa, sol, la, ti, do.He claimed that in the harmony of the spheres, the tones of Earth are fa and mi, that theEarth is forever humming fa and mi, and that they stand in a straightforward way for theLatin word for famine. He argued, not unsuccessfully, that the Earth was best described bythat single doleful word.","228":"Exactly eight days after Kepler\u2019s discovery of his third law, the incident thatunleashed the Thirty Years\u2019 War transpired in Prague. The war\u2019s convulsions shattered thelives of millions, Kepler among them. He lost his wife and son to an epidemic carried bythe soldiery, his royal patron was deposed, and he was excommunicated by the LutheranChurch for his uncompromising individualism on matters of doctrine. Kepler was a refugeeonce again. The conflict, portrayed by both the Catholics and the Protestants as a holy war,was more an exploitation of religious fanaticism by those hungry for land and power. In thepast, wars had tended to be resolved when the belligerent princes had exhausted theirresources. But now organized pillage was introduced as a means of keeping armies in thefield. The savaged population of Europe stood helpless as plowshares and pruning hookswere literally beaten into swords and spears.*","229":"* Some examples are still to be seen in the Graz armory.","230":"Waves of rumor and paranoia swept through the countryside, enveloping especiallythe powerless. Among the many scapegoats chosen were elderly women living alone, whowere charged with witchcraft. Kepler\u2019s mother was carried away in the middle of the nightin a laundry chest. In Kepler\u2019s little hometown of Weil der Stadt, roughly three womenwere tortured and killed as witches every year between 1615 and 1629. And KatharinaKepler was a cantankerous old woman. She engaged in disputes that annoyed the localnobility, and she sold soporific and perhaps hallucinogenic drugs as do contemporaryMexican curanderas. Poor Kepler believed that he himself had contributed to her arrest.","231":"It came about because Kepler wrote one of the first works of science fiction,intended to explain and popularize science. It was called the Somnium, \u2018The Dream.\u2019 Heimagined a journey to the Moon, the space travelers standing on the lunar surface andobserving the lovely planet Earth rotating slowly in the sky above them. By changing ourperspective we can figure out how worlds work. In Kepler\u2019s time one of the chiefobjections to the idea that the Earth turns was the fact that people do not feel the motion. Inthe Somnium he tried to make the rotation of the Earth plausible, dramatic, comprehensible:\u2018As long as the multitude does not err .... I want to be on the side of the many. Therefore, Itake great pains to explain to as many people as possible.\u2019 (On another occasion he wrote ina letter, \u2018Do not sentence me completely to the treadmill of mathematical calculations -leave me time for philosophical speculations, my sole delight.\u2019*)","232":"* Brahe, like Kepler, was far from hostile to astrology, although he carefully distinguished his ownsecret version of astrology from the more common variants of his time, which he thought conducive tosuperstition. In his book Astronomiae Instauratae Mechonica, published in 1598, he argued that astrology is\u2018really more reliable than one would think\u2019 if charts of the position of the stars were properly improved. Brahewrote: \u2018I have been occupied in alchemy, as much as by the celestial studies, from my 23rd year.\u2019 But both ofthese pseudosciences, he felt, had secrets far too dangerous for the general populace (although entirely safe,he thought, in the hands of those princes and kings from whom he sought support). Brahe continued the longand truly dangerous tradition of some scientists who believe that only they and the temporal and ecclesiasticalpowers can be trusted with arcane knowledge: \u2018It serves no useful purpose and is unreasonable, to make suchthings generally known.\u2019 Kepler, on the other hand, lectured on astronomy in schools, published extensivelyand often at his own expense, and wrote science fiction, which was certainly not intended primarily for hisscientific peers. He may not have been a popular writer of science in the modern sense, but the transition inattitudes in the single generation that separated Tycho and Kepler is telling.","233":"With the invention of the telescope, what Kepler called \u2018lunar geography\u2019 wasbecoming possible. In the Somnium , he described the Moon as filled with mountains andvalleys and as \u2018porous, as though dug through with hollows and continuous caves,\u2019 areference to the lunar craters Galileo had recently discovered with the first astronomicaltelescope. He also imagined that the Moon had its inhabitants, well adapted to theinclemencies of the local environment. He describes the slowly rotating Earth viewed fromthe lunar surface and imagines the continents and oceans of our planet to produce someassociative image like the Man in the Moon. He pictures the near contact of southern Spainwith North Africa at the Straits of Gibraltar as a young woman in a flowing dress about tokiss her lover - although rubbing noses looks more like it to me.","234":"Because of the length of the lunar day and night Kepler described \u2018the greatintemperateness of climate and the most violent alternation of extreme heat and cold on theMoon,\u2019 which is entirely correct. Of course, he did not get everything right. He believed,for example, that there was a substantial lunar atmosphere and oceans and inhabitants. Mostcurious is his view of the origin of the lunar craters, which make the Moon, he says, \u2018notdissimilar to the face of a boy disfigured with smallpox.\u2019 He argued correctly that thecraters are depressions rather than mounds. From his own observations he noted theramparts surrounding many craters and the existence of central peaks. But he thought thattheir regular circular shape implied such a degree of order that only intelligent life couldexplain them. He did not realize that great rocks falling out of the sky would produce alocal explosion, perfectly symmetric in all directions, that would carve out a circular cavity- the origin of the bulk of the craters on the Moon and the other terrestrial planets. Hededuced instead \u2018the existence of some race rationally capable of constructing thosehollows on the surface of the Moon. This race must have many individuals, so that onegroup puts one hollow to use while another group constructs another hollow.\u2019 Against theview that such great construction projects were unlikely, Kepler offered as counterexamplesthe pyramids of Egypt and the Great Wall of China, which can, in fact, be seen today fromEarth orbit. The idea that geometrical order reveals an underlying intelligence was centralto Kepler\u2019s life. His argument on the lunar craters is a clear foreshadowing of the Martiancanal controversy (Chapter 5). It is striking that the observational search for extraterrestriallife began in the same generation as the invention of the telescope, and with the greatesttheoretician of the age.","235":"Parts of the Somnium were clearly autobiographical. The hero, for example, visitsTycho Brahe. He has parents who sell drugs. His mother consorts with spirits and daemons,one of whom eventually provides the means to travel to the moon. The Somnium makesclear to us, although it did not to all of Kepler\u2019s contemporaries, that \u2018in a dream one mustbe allowed the liberty of imagining occasionally that which never existed in the world ofsense perception.\u2019 Science fiction was a new idea at the time of the Thirty Years\u2019 War, andKepler\u2019s book was used as evidence that his mother was a witch.","236":"In the midst of other grave personal problems. Kepler rushed to Wiirttemberg tofind his seventy-four-year-old mother chained in a Protestant secular dungeon andthreatened, like Galileo in a Catholic dungeon, with torture. He set about, as a scientistnaturally would, to find natural explanations for the various events that had precipitated theaccusations of witchcraft, including minor physical ailments that the burghers ofWiirttemberg had attributed to her spells. The research was successful, a triumph, as wasmuch of the rest of his life, of reason over superstition. His mother was exiled, with asentence of death passed on her should she ever return to Wiirttemberg; and Kepler\u2019sspirited defense apparently led to a decree by the Duke forbidding further trials forwitchcraft on such slender evidence.","237":"The upheavals of the war deprived Kepler of much of his financial support, and theend of his life was spent fitfully, pleading for money and sponsors. He cast horoscopes forthe Duke of Wallenstein, as he had done for Rudolf II, and spent his final years in aSilesian town controlled by Wallenstein and called Sagan. His epitaph, which he himselfcomposed, was: \u2018I measured the skies, now the shadows I measure. Sky-bound was the","238":"mind, Earth-bound the body rests.\u2019 But the Thirty Years\u2019 War obliterated his grave. If amarker were to be erected today, it might read, in homage to his scientific courage: \u2018Hepreferred the hard truth to his dearest illusions.\u2019","239":"Johannes Kepler believed that there would one day be \u2018celestial ships with sailsadapted to the winds of heaven\u2019 navigating the sky, filled with explorers \u2018who would notfear the vastness\u2019 of space. And today those explorers, human and robot, employ asunerring guides on their voyages through the vastness of space the three laws of planetarymotion that Kepler uncovered during a lifetime of personal travail and ecstatic discovery.","240":"The lifelong quest of Johannes Kepler, to understand the motions of the planets, to seek aharmony in the heavens, culminated thirty-six years after his death, in the work of IsaacNewton. Newton was born on Christmas Day, 1642, so tiny that, as his mother told himyears later, he would have fit into a quart mug. Sickly, feeling abandoned by his parents,quarrelsome, unsociable, a virgin to the day he died, Isaac Newton was perhaps the greatestscientific genius who ever lived.","241":"Even as a young man, Newton was impatient with insubstantial questions, such aswhether light was \u2018a substance or an accident,\u2019 or how gravitation could act over anintervening vacuum. He early decided that the conventional Christian belief in the Trinitywas a misreading of Scripture. According to his biographer, John Maynard Keynes,","242":"He was rather a Judaic Monotheist of the school of Maimonides. He arrived at thisconclusion, not on so-to-speak rational or sceptical grounds, but entirely on theinterpretation of ancient authority. He was persuaded that the revealed documentsgave no support to the Trinitarian doctrines which were due to late falsifications.","243":"The revealed God was one God. But this was a dreadful secret which Newton was atdesperate pains to conceal all his life.","244":"Like Kepler, he was not immune to the superstitions of his day and had many encounterswith mysticism. Indeed, much of Newton\u2019s intellectual development can be attributed tothis tension between rationalism and mysticism. At the Stourbridge Fair in 1663, at agetwenty, he purchased a book on astrology, \u2018out of a curiosity to see what there was in it.\u2019","245":"He read it until he came to an illustration which he could not understand, because he wasignorant of trigonometry. So he purchased a book on trigonometry but soon found himselfunable to follow the geometrical arguments. So he found a copy of Euclid\u2019s Elements ofGeometry, and began to read. Two years later he invented the differential calculus.","246":"As a student, Newton was fascinated by light and transfixed by the Sun. He took tothe dangerous practice of staring at the Sun\u2019s image in a looking glass:","247":"In a few hours I had brought my eyes to such a pass that I could look upon no brightobject with neither eye but I saw the Sun before me, so that I durst neither write norread but to recover the use of my eyes shut my self up in my chamber made darkthree days together & used all means to divert my imagination from the Sun. For if Ithought upon him I presently saw his picture though I was in the dark.","248":"In 1666, at the age of twenty-three, Newton was an undergraduate at Cambridge Universitywhen an outbreak of plague forced him to spend a year in idleness in the isolated village ofWoolsthorpe, where he had been born. He occupied himself by inventing the differentialand integral calculus, making fundamental discoveries on the nature of light and laying thefoundation for the theory of universal gravitation. The only other year like it in the historyof physics was Einstein\u2019s \u2018Miracle Year\u2019 of 1905. When asked how he accomplished hisastonishing discoveries, Newton replied unhelpfully, \u2018By thinking upon them.\u2019 His workwas so significant that his teacher at Cambridge, Isaac Barrow, resigned his chair ofmathematics in favor of Newton five years after the young student returned to college.Newton, in his mid-forties, was described by his servant as follows:","249":"I never knew him to take any recreation or pastime either in riding out to take the air,walking, bowling, or any other exercise whatever, thinking all hours lost that werenot spent in his studies, to which he kept so close that he seldom left his chamberunless [to lecture] at term time . . . where so few went to hear him, and fewerunderstood him, that ofttimes he did in a manner, for want of hearers, read to thewalls.","250":"Students both of Kepler and of Newton never knew what they were missing.","251":"Newton discovered the law of inertia, the tendency of a moving object to continuemoving in a straight line unless something influences it and moves it out of its path. TheMoon, it seemed to Newton, would fly off in a straight line, tangential to its orbit, unlessthere were some other force constantly diverting the path into a near circle, pulling it in thedirection of the Earth. This force Newton called gravity, and believed that it acted at adistance. There is nothing physically connecting the Earth and the Moon. And yet the Earthis constantly pulling the Moon toward us. Using Kepler\u2019s third law, Newtonmathematically deduced the nature of the gravitational force.* He showed that the sameforce that pulls an apple down to Earth keeps the Moon in its orbit and accounts for therevolutions of the then recently discovered moons of Jupiter in their orbits about thatdistant planet.","252":"* Sadly, Newton does not acknowledge his debt to Kepler in his masterpiece the Principia. But in a1686 letter to Edmund Halley, he says of his law of gravitation: \"I can affirm that I gathered it from Kepler\u2019stheorem about twenty years ago.\u2019","253":"Things had been falling down since the beginning of time. That the Moon wentaround the Earth had been believed for all of human history. Newton was the first personever to figure out that these two phenomena were due to the same force. This is themeaning of the word \u2018universal\u2019 as applied to Newtonian gravitation. The same law ofgravity applies everywhere in the universe.","254":"It is a law of the inverse square. The force declines inversely as the square ofdistance. If two objects are moved twice as far away, the gravity now pulling them togetheris only one-quarter as strong. If they are moved ten times farther away, the gravity is ten","255":"2","256":"squared, 10\u201c = 100 times smaller. Clearly, the force must in some sense be inverse - that is,declining with distance. If the force were direct, increasing with distance, then the strongestforce would work on the most distant objects, and I suppose all the matter in the universewould find itself careering together into a single cosmic lump. No, gravity must decreasewith distance, which is why a comet or a planet moves slowly when far from the Sun andfaster when close to the Sun - the gravity it feels is weaker the farther from the Sun it is.","257":"All three of Kepler\u2019s laws of planetary motion can be derived from Newtonianprinciples. Kepler\u2019s laws were empirical, based upon the painstaking observations of TychoBrahe. Newton\u2019s laws were theoretical, rather simple mathematical abstractions from whichall of Tycho\u2019s measurements could ultimately be derived. From these laws, Newton wrotewith undisguised pride in the Principia, \u2018I now demonstrate the frame of the System of theWorld.\u2019","258":"Later in his life, Newton presided over the Royal Society, a fellowship of scientists,and was Master of the Mint, where he devoted his energies to the suppression of counterfeitcoinage. His natural moodiness and reclusivity grew; he resolved to abandon thosescientific endeavors that brought him into quarrelsome disputes with other scientists,chiefly on issues of priority; and there were those who spread tales that he had experiencedthe seventeenth-century equivalent of a \u2018nervous breakdown.\u2019 However, Newton continuedhis lifelong experiments on the border between alchemy and chemistry, and some recentevidence suggests that what he was suffering from was not so much a psychogenic ailmentas heavy metal poisoning, induced by systematic ingestion of small quantities of arsenicand mercury. It was a common practice for chemists of the time to use the sense of taste asan analytic tool.","259":"Nevertheless his prodigious intellectual powers persisted unabated. In 1696, theSwiss mathematician Johann Bernoulli challenged his colleagues to solve an unresolvedissue called the brachistochrone problem, specifying the curve connecting two pointsdisplaced from each other laterally, along which a body, acted upon by gravity, would fallin the shortest time. Bernoulli originally specified a deadline of six months, but extended itto a year and a half at the request of Leibniz, one of the leading scholars of the time, and theman who had, independently of Newton, invented the differential and integral calculus. Thechallenge was delivered to Newton at four P.M. on January 29, 1697. Before leaving forwork the next morning, he had invented an entire new branch of mathematics called thecalculus of variations, used it to solve the brachistochrone problem and sent off the solution,which was published, at Newton\u2019s request, anonymously. But the brilliance and originalityof the work betrayed the identity of its author. When Bernoulli saw the solution, hecommented. \u2018We recognize the lion by his claw.\u2019 Newton was then in his fifty- fifth year.","260":"The major intellectual pursuit of his last years was a concordance and calibration ofthe chronologies of ancient civilizations, very much in the tradition of the ancient historiansManetho, Strabo and Eratosthenes. In his last, posthumous work, \u2018The Chronology ofAncient Kingdoms Amended,\u2019 we find repeated astronomical calibrations of historicalevents; an architectural reconstruction of the Temple of Solomon; a provocative claim thatall the Northern Hemisphere constellations are named after the personages, artifacts andevents in the Greek story of Jason and the Argonauts, and the consistent assumption thatthe gods of all civilizations, with the single exception of Newton\u2019s own, were merely","261":"ancient kings and heroes deified by later generations.","262":"Kepler and Newton represent a critical transition in human history, the discoverythat fairly simple mathematical laws pervade all of Nature; that the same rules apply onEarth as in the skies; and that there is a resonance between the way we think and the waythe world works. They unflinchingly respected the accuracy of observational data, and theirpredictions of the motion of the planets to high precision provided compelling evidence that,at an unexpectedly deep level, humans can understand the Cosmos. Our modern globalcivilization, our view of the world and our present exploration of the Universe areprofoundly indebted to their insights.","263":"Newton was guarded about his discoveries and fiercely competitive with hisscientific colleagues. He thought nothing of waiting a decade or two after its discovery topublish the inverse square law. But before the grandeur and intricacy of Nature, he was,like Ptolemy and Kepler, exhilarated as well as disarmingly modest. Just before his deathhe wrote: \u2018I do not know what I may appear to the world; but to myself I seem to have beenonly like a boy, playing on the seashore, and diverting myself, in now and then finding asmoother pebble or a prettier shell than ordinary, while the great ocean of truth lay allundiscovered before me.\u2019","264":"Heaven and Hell","265":"Nine worlds I remember.","266":"- The Icelandic Edda of Snorri Sturluson, 1200","267":"I am become death, the shatterer of worlds.","268":"- Bhagavad Gita","269":"The doors of heaven and hell are adjacent and identical.","270":"- Nikos Kazantzakis, The Last Temptation of Christ","271":"The Earth is a lovely and more or less placid place. Things change, but slowly. We can leada full life and never personally encounter a natural disaster more violent than a storm. Andso we become complacent, relaxed, unconcerned. But in the history of Nature, the record isclear. Worlds have been devastated. Even we humans have achieved the dubious technicaldistinction of being able to make our own disasters, both intentional and inadvertent. Onthe landscapes of other planets where the records of the past have been preserved, there isabundant evidence of major catastrophes. It is all a matter of time scale. An event thatwould be unthinkable in a hundred years may be inevitable in a hundred million. Even onthe Earth, even in our own century, bizarre natural events have occurred.","272":"In the early morning hours of June 30, 1908, in Central Siberia, a giant fireball wasseen moving rapidly across the sky. Where it touched the horizon, an enormous explosiontook place. It leveled some 2,000 square kilometers of forest and burned thousands of treesin a flash fire near the impact site. It produced an atmospheric shock wave that twicecircled the Earth. For two days afterwards, there was so much fine dust in the atmospherethat one could read a newspaper at night by scattered light in the streets of London, 10,000kilometers away.","273":"The government of Russia under the Czars could not be bothered to investigate sotrivial an event, which, after all, had occurred far away, among the backward Tunguspeople of Siberia. It was ten years after the Revolution before an expedition arrived toexamine the ground and interview the witnesses. These are some of the accounts theybrought back:","274":"Early in the morning when everyone was asleep in the tent, it was blown up into theair, together with the occupants. When they fell back to Earth, the whole familysuffered slight bruises, but Akulina and Ivan actually lost consciousness. When theyregained consciousness they heard a great deal of noise and saw the forest blazinground them and much of it devastated.","275":"I was sitting in the porch of the house at the trading station of Vanovara at breakfasttime and looking towards the north. I had just raised my axe to hoop a cask, when","276":"suddenly . . . the sky was split in two, and high above the forest the whole northernpart of the sky appeared to be covered with fire. At that moment I felt a great heat asif my shirt had caught fire ... I wanted to pull off my shirt and throw it away, but atthat moment there was a bang in the sky, and a mighty crash was heard. I wasthrown on the ground about three sajenes away from the porch and for a moment Ilost consciousness. My wife ran out and carried me into the hut. The crash wasfollowed by a noise like stones falling from the sky, or guns firing. The Earthtrembled, and when I lay on the ground I covered my head because I was afraid thatstones might hit it. At that moment when the sky opened, a hot wind, as from acannon, blew past the huts from the north. It left its mark on the ground . . .","277":"When I sat down to have my breakfast beside my plough, I heard sudden bangs, asif from gun-fire. My horse fell to its knees. From the north side above the forest aflame shot up . . . Then I saw that the fir forest had been bent over by the wind and Ithought of a hurricane. I seized hold of my plough with both hands, so that it wouldnot be carried away. The wind was so strong that it carried off some of the soil fromthe surface of the ground, and then the hurricane drove a wall of water up theAngara. I saw it all quite clearly, because my land was on a hillside.","278":"The roar frightened the horses to such an extent that some galloped off in panic,dragging the ploughs in different directions, and others collapsed.","279":"The carpenters, after the first and second crashes, had crossed themselves instupefaction, and when the third crash resounded they fell backwards from thebuilding onto the chips of wood. Some of them were so stunned and utterly terrifiedthat I had to calm them down and reassure them. We all abandoned work and wentinto the village. There, whole crowds of local inhabitants were gathered in thestreets in terror, talking about this phenomenon.","280":"I was in the fields . . . and had only just got one horse harnessed to the harrow andbegun to attach another when suddenly I heard what sounded like a single loud shotto the right. I immediately turned round and saw an elongated flaming object flyingthrough the sky. The front part was much broader than the tail end and its color waslike fire in the day-time. It was many times bigger than the sun but much dimmer,so that it was possible to look at it with the naked eye. Behind the flames trailedwhat looked like dust. It was wreathed in little puffs, and blue streamers were leftbehind from the flames ... As soon as the flame had disappeared, bangs louder thanshots from a gun were heard, the ground could be felt to tremble, and the windowpanes in the cabin were shattered.","281":"... I was washing wool on the bank of the River Kan. Suddenly a noise like thefluttering of the wings of a frightened bird was heard . . . and a kind of swell cameup the river. After this came a single sharp bang so loud that one of the workmen . . .fell into the water.","282":"This remarkable occurrence is called the Tunguska Event. Some scientists have suggestedthat it was caused by a piece of hurtling antimatter, annihilated on contact with the ordinarymatter of the Earth, disappearing in a flash of gamma rays. But the absence of radioactivityat the impact site gives no support to this explanation. Others postulate that a mini blackhole passed through the Earth in Siberia and out the other side. But the records ofatmospheric shock waves show no hint of an object booming out of the North Atlantic laterthat day. Perhaps it was a spaceship of some unimaginably advanced extraterrestrialcivilization in desperate mechanical trouble, crashing in a remote region of an obscureplanet. But at the site of the impact there is no trace of such a ship. Each of these ideas hasbeen proposed, some of them more or less seriously. Not one of them is strongly supportedby the evidence. The key point of the Tunguska Event is that there was a tremendousexplosion, a great shock wave, an enormous forest fire, and yet there is no impact crater atthe site. There seems to be only one explanation consistent with all the facts: In 1908 apiece of comet hit the Earth.","283":"In the vast spaces between the planets there are many objects, some rocky, somemetallic, some icy, some composed partly of organic molecules. They range from grains ofdust to irregular blocks the size of Nicaragua or Bhutan. And sometimes, by accident, thereis a planet in the way. The Tunguska Event was probably caused by an icy cometaryfragment about a hundred meters across - the size of a football field - weighing a milliontons, moving at about 30 kilometers per second, 70,000 miles per hour.","284":"If such an impact occurred today it might be mistaken, especially in the panic of themoment, for a nuclear explosion. The cometary impact and fireball would simulate alleffects of a one-megaton nuclear burst, including the mushroom cloud, with twoexceptions: there would be no gamma radiation or radioactive fallout. Could a rare butnatural event, the impact of a sizable cometary fragment, trigger a nuclear war? A strangescenario: a small comet hits the Earth, as millions of them have, and the response of ourcivilization is promptly to self-destruct. It might be a good idea for us to understand cometsand collisions and catastrophes a little better than we do. For example, an American Velasatellite detected an intense double flash of light from the vicinity of the South Atlantic andWestern Indian Ocean on September 22, 1979. Early speculation held that it was aclandestine test of a low yield (two kilotons, about a sixth the energy of the Hiroshimabomb) nuclear weapon by South Africa or Israel. The political consequences wereconsidered serious around the world. But what if the flashes were instead caused by theimpact of a small asteroid or a piece of a comet? Since airborne over-flights in the vicinityof the flashes showed not a trace of unusual radioactivity in the air, this is a real possibilityand underscores the dangers in an age of nuclear weapons of not monitoring impacts fromspace better than we do.","285":"A comet is made mostly of ice - water (H2O) ice, with a little methane (CH4) ice,and some ammonia (NH3) ice. Striking the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, a modest cometaryfragment would produce a great radiant fireball and a mighty blast wave, which would burntrees, level forests and be heard around the world. But it might not make much of a crater inthe ground. The ices would all be melted during entry. There would be few recognizable","286":"pieces of the comet left - perhaps only a smattering of small grains from the non-icy partsof the cometary nucleus. Recently, the Soviet scientist E. Sobotovich has identified a largenumber of tiny diamonds strewn over the Tunguska site. Such diamonds are already knownto exist in meteorites that have survived impact, and that may originate ultimately fromcomets.","287":"On many a clear night, if you look patiently up at the sky, you will see a solitarymeteor blazing briefly overhead. On some nights you can see a shower of meteors, alwayson the same few days of every year - a natural fireworks display, an entertainment in theheavens. These meteors are made by tiny grains, smaller than a mustard seed. They are lessshooting stars than falling fluff. Momentarily brilliant as they enter the Earth\u2019s atmosphere,they are heated and destroyed by friction at a height of about 100 kilometers. Meteors arethe remnants of comets.* Old comets, heated by repeated passages near the Sun, break up,evaporate and disintegrate. The debris spreads to fill the full cometary orbit. Where thatorbit intersects the orbit of the Earth, there is a swarm of meteors waiting for us. Some partof the swarm is always at the same position in the Earth\u2019s orbit, so the meteor shower isalways observed on the same day of every year. June 30, 1908 was the day of the BetaTaurid meteor shower, connected with the orbit of Comet Encke. The Tunguska Eventseems to have been caused by a chunk of Comet Encke, a piece substantially larger than thetiny fragments that cause those glittering, harmless meteor showers.","288":"* That meteors and meteorites are connected with the comets was first proposed by Alexander vonHumboldt in his broad-gauge popularization of all of science, published in the years 1845 to 1862, a workcalled Kosmos. It was reading Humboldt\u2019s earlier work that fired the young Charles Darwin to embark on acareer combining geographical exploration and natural history. Shortly thereafter he accepted a position asnaturalist aboard the ship HMS Beagle, the event that led to The Origin of Species.","289":"Comets have always evoked fear and awe and superstition. Their occasionalapparitions disturbingly challenged the notion of an unalterable and divinely orderedCosmos. It seemed inconceivable that a spectacular streak of milk-white flame, rising andsetting with the stars night after night, was not there for a reason, did not hold some portentfor human affairs. So the idea arose that comets were harbingers of disaster, auguries ofdivine wrath - that they foretold the deaths of princes, the fall of kingdoms. TheBabylonians thought that comets were celestial beards. The Greeks thought of flowing hair,the Arabs of flaming swords. In Ptolemy\u2019s time comets were elaborately classified as\u2018beams,\u2019 \u2018trumpets,\u2019 \u2018jars\u2019 and so on, according to their shapes. Ptolemy thought thatcomets bring wars, hot weather and \u2018disturbed conditions.\u2019 Some medieval depictions ofcomets resemble unidentified flying crucifixes. A Lutheran \u2018Superintendent\u2019 or Bishop ofMagdeburg named Andreas Celichius published in 1578 a \u2018Theological Reminder of theNew Comet,\u2019 which offered the inspired view that a comet is \u2018the thick smoke of humansins, rising every day, every hour, every moment, full of stench and horror before the faceof God, and becoming gradually so thick as to form a comet, with curled and plaited tresses,which at last is kindled by the hot and fiery anger of the Supreme Heavenly Judge.\u2019 Butothers countered that if comets were the smoke of sin, the skies would be continuallyablaze with them.","290":"The most ancient record of an apparition of Halley\u2019s (or any other) Comet appearsin the Chinese Book of Prince Huai Nan, attendant to the march of King Wu against Zhouof Yin. The year was 1057 B.C. The approach to Earth of Halley\u2019s Comet in the year 66 isthe probable explanation of the account by Josephus of a sword that hung over Jerusalemfor a whole year. In 1066 the Normans witnessed another return of Halley\u2019s Comet. Since itmust, they thought, presage the fall of some kingdom, the comet encouraged, in some senseprecipitated, the invasion of England by William the Conqueror. The comet was duly notedin a newspaper of the time, the Bayeux Tapestry. In 1301, Giotto, one of the founders ofmodern realistic painting, witnessed another apparition of Comet Halley and inserted it intoa nativity scene. The Great Comet of 1466 - yet another return of Halley\u2019s Comet -panicked Christian Europe; the Christians feared that God, who sends comets, might be onthe side of the Turks, who had just captured Constantinople.","291":"The leading astronomers of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries were fascinatedby comets, and even Newton became a little giddy over them. Kepler described comets asdarting through space \u2018as the fishes in the sea,\u2019 but being dissipated by sunlight, as thecometary tail always points away from the sun. David Hume, in many cases anuncompromising rationalist, at least toyed with the notion that comets were thereproductive cells - the eggs or sperm - of planetary systems, that planets are produced by akind of interstellar sex. As an undergraduate, before his invention of the reflectingtelescope, Newton spent many consecutive sleepless nights searching the sky for cometswith his naked eye, pursuing them with such fervor that he felt ill from exhaustion.Following Tycho and Kepler, Newton concluded that the comets seen from Earth do notmove within our atmosphere, as Aristotle and others had thought, but rather are moredistant than the Moon, although closer than Saturn. Comets shine, as the planets do, byreflected sunlight, \u2018and they are much mistaken who remove them almost as far as the fixedstars; for if it were so, the comets could receive no more light from our Sun than our planetsdo from the fixed stars.\u2019 He showed that comets, like planets, move in ellipses: \u2018Comets area sort of planets revolved in very eccentric orbits about the Sun.\u2019 This demystification, thisprediction of regular cometary orbits, led his friend Edmund Halley in 1707 to calculatethat the comets of 1531, 1607 and 1682 were apparitions at 76-year intervals of the samecomet, and predicted its return in 1758. The comet duly arrived and was named for himposthumously. Comet Halley has played an interesting role in human history, and may bethe target of the first space vehicle probe of a comet, during its return in 1986.","292":"Modern planetary scientists sometimes argue that the collision of a comet with aplanet might make a significant contribution to the planetary atmosphere. For example, allthe water in the atmosphere of Mars today could be accounted for by a recent impact of asmall comet. Newton noted that the matter in the tails of comets is dissipated ininterplanetary space, lost to the comet and little by little attracted gravitationally to nearbyplanets. He believed that the water on the Earth is gradually being lost, \u2018spent uponvegetation and putrefaction, and converted into dry earth . . . The fluids, if they are notsupplied from without, must be in a continual decrease, and quite fail at last.\u2019 Newtonseems to have believed that the Earth\u2019s oceans are of cometary origin, and that life ispossible only because cometary matter falls upon our planet. In a mystical reverie, he wentstill further: \u2018I suspect, moreover, that it is chiefly from the comets that spirit comes, which","293":"is indeed the smallest but the most subtle and useful part of our air, and so much required tosustain the life of all things with us.\u2019","294":"As early as 1868 the astronomer William Huggins found an identity between somefeatures in the spectrum of a comet and the spectrum of natural or \u2018olefiant\u2019 gas. Hugginshad found organic matter in the comets; in subsequent years cyanogen, CN, consisting of acarbon and a nitrogen atom, the molecular fragment that makes cyanides, was identified inthe tails of comets. When the Earth was about to pass through the tail of Halley\u2019s Comet in1910, many people panicked. They overlooked the fact that the tail of a comet isextravagantly diffuse: the actual danger from the poison in a comet\u2019s tail is far less than thedanger, even in 1910, from industrial pollution in large cities.","295":"But that reassured almost no one. For example, headlines in the San FranciscoChronicle for May 15, 1910, include \u2018Comet Camera as Big as a House,\u2019 \u2018Comet Comesand Husband Reforms,\u2019 \u2018Comet Parties Now Fad in New York.\u2019 The Fos AngelesExaminer adopted a light mood: \u2018Say!

Entrepreneurs hawked anti-cometpills and gas masks, the latter an eerie premonition of the battlefields of World War 1.","296":"Some confusion about comets continues to our own time. In 1957, 1 was a graduatestudent at the University of Chicago\u2019s Yerkes Observatory. Alone in the observatory lateone night, I heard the telephone ring persistently.

But if you don\u2019t lookat it, there it is.\u2019 The most sensitive part of the retina is not at the center of the field of view.You can see faint stars and other objects by averting your vision slightly. I knew that,barely visible in the sky at this time, was a newly discovered comet called Arend-Roland.","297":"So I told him that he was probably looking at a comet. There was a long pause, followed bythe query: \u2018Wash\u2019a comet?\u2019 \u2018A comet,\u2019 I replied, \u2018is a snowball one mile across.\u2019 There wasa longer pause, after which the caller requested, \u2018Femme talk to a real shtrominer.\u2019 WhenHalley\u2019s Comet reappears in 1986, 1 wonder what political leaders will fear the apparition,what other silliness will then be upon us.","298":"While the planets move in elliptical orbits around the Sun, their orbits are not veryelliptical. At first glance they are, by and large, indistinguishable from circles. It is thecomets - especially the long-period comets - that have dramatically elliptical orbits. Theplanets are the old-timers in the inner solar system; the comets are the newcomers. Why arethe planetary orbits nearly circular and neatly separated one from the other? Because ifplanets had very elliptical orbits, so that their paths intersected, sooner or later there wouldbe a collision. In the early history of the solar system, there were probably many planets inthe process of formation. Those with elliptical crossing orbits tended to collide and destroythemselves. Those with circular orbits tended to grow and survive. The orbits of the presentplanets are the orbits of the survivors of this collisional natural selection, the stable middleage of a solar system dominated by early catastrophic impacts.","299":"In the outermost solar system, in the gloom far beyond the planets, there is a vast","300":"spherical cloud of a trillion cometary nuclei, orbiting the Sun no faster than a racing car atthe Indianapolis 500.* A fairly typical comet would look like a giant tumbling snowballabout 1 kilometer across. Most never penetrate the border marked by the orbit of Pluto. Butoccasionally a passing star makes a gravitational flurry and commotion in the cometarycloud, and a group of comets finds itself in highly elliptical orbits, plunging toward the Sun.After its path is further changed by gravitational encounters with Jupiter or Saturn, it tendsto find itself, once every century or so, careering toward the inner solar system. Somewherebetween the orbits of Jupiter and Mars it would begin heating and evaporating. Matterblown outwards from the Sun\u2019s atmosphere, the solar wind, carries fragments of dust andice back behind the comet, making an incipient tail. If Jupiter were a meter across, ourcomet would be smaller than a speck of dust, but when fully developed, its tail would be asgreat as the distances between the worlds. When within sight of the Earth on each of itsorbits, it would stimulate outpourings of superstitious fervor among the Earthlings. Buteventually they would understand that it lived not in their atmosphere, but out among theplanets. They would calculate its orbit. And perhaps one day soon they would launch asmall space vehicle devoted to exploring this visitor from the realm of the stars.","301":"* The Earth is r = 1 astronomical unit = 150,000,000 kilometers from the Sun. Its roughly circularorbit then has a circumference of 2jtr = 1 0 9 km. Our planet circulates once along this path every year. One year= 3 x 10 7 seconds. So the Earth\u2019s orbital speed is 10 9 km\/3 x 10 7 sec =30 km\/sec. Now consider the sphericalshell of orbiting comets that many astronomers believe surrounds the solar system at a distance =100,000astronomical units, almost halfway to the nearest star. From Kepler\u2019s third law it immediately follows that theorbital period about the Sun of any one of them is about ( 10 5 ) 3\/2 = 10 73 =3 x 10 7 or 30 million years. Oncearound the Sun is a long time if you live in the outer reaches of the solar system. The cometary orbit is 2;ta =2k x 10 5 x 1.5 x 10 s km =10 14 km around, and its speed is therefore only 10 l4 km\/ 10 15 sec = 0.1 km\/sec =220miles per hour.","302":"Sooner or later comets will collide with planets. The Earth and its companion theMoon must be bombarded by comets and small asteroids, debris left over from theformation of the solar system. Since there are more small objects than large ones, thereshould be more impacts by small objects than by large ones. An impact of a small cometaryfragment with the Earth, as at Tunguska, should occur about once every thousand years.","303":"But an impact with a large comet, such as Halley\u2019s Comet, whose nucleus is perhapstwenty kilometers across, should occur only about once every billion years.","304":"When a small, icy object collides with a planet or a moon, it may not produce a verymajor scar. But if the impacting object is larger or made primarily of rock, there is anexplosion on impact that carves out a hemispherical bowl called an impact crater. And if noprocess rubs out or fills in the crater, it may last for billions of years. Almost no erosionoccurs on the Moon and when we examine its surface, we find it covered with impactcraters, many more than can be accounted for by the rather sparse population of cometaryand asteroidal debris that now fills the inner solar system. The lunar surface offers eloquenttestimony of a previous age of the destruction of worlds, now billions of years gone.","305":"Impact craters are not restricted to the Moon. We find them throughout the innersolar system - from Mercury, closest to the Sun, to cloud-covered Venus to Mars and itstiny moons, Phobos and Deimos. These are the terrestrial planets, our family of worlds, the","306":"planets more or less like the Earth. They have solid surfaces, interiors made of rock andiron, and atmospheres ranging from near-vacuum to pressures ninety times higher than theEarth\u2019s. They huddle around the Sun, the source of light and heat, like campers around afire. The planets are all about 4.6 billion years old. Like the Moon, they all bear witness toan age of impact catastrophism in the early history of the solar system.","307":"As we move out past Mars we enter a very different regime - the realm of Jupiterand the other giant or Jovian planets. These are great worlds, composed largely of hydrogenand helium, with smaller amounts of hydrogen-rich gases such as methane, ammonia andwater. We do not see solid surfaces here, only the atmosphere and the multicolored clouds.These are serious planets, not fragmentary worldlets like the Earth. A thousand Earthscould fit inside Jupiter. If a comet or an asteroid dropped into the atmosphere of Jupiter, wewould not expect a visible crater, only a momentary break in the clouds. Nevertheless, weknow there has been a many-billion-year history of collisions in the outer solar system aswell - because Jupiter has a great system of more than a dozen moons, five of which wereexamined close up by the Voyager spacecraft. Here again we find evidence of pastcatastrophes. When the solar system is all explored, we will probably have evidence forimpact catastrophism on all nine worlds, from Mercury to Pluto, and on all the smallermoons, comets and asteroids.","308":"There are about 10,000 craters on the near side of the Moon, visible to telescopes onEarth. Most of them are in the ancient lunar highlands and date from the time of the finalaccretion of the Moon from interplanetary debris. There are about a thousand craters largerthan a kilometer across in the maria (Latin for \u2018seas\u2019), the lowland regions that wereflooded, perhaps by lava, shortly after the formation of the Moon, covering over thepre-existing craters. Thus, very roughly, craters on the Moon should be formed today at therate of about 10 9 years\/10 4 craters, = 10 5 years\/crater, a hundred thousand years betweencratering events. Since there may have been more interplanetary debris a few billion yearsago than there is today, we might have to wait even longer than a hundred thousand yearsto see a crater form on the Moon. Because the Earth has a larger area than the Moon, wemight have to wait something like ten thousand years between collisions that would makecraters as big as a kilometer across on our planet. And since Meteor Crater, Arizona, animpact crater about a kilometer across, has been found to be twenty or thirty thousand yearsold, the observations on the Earth are in agreement with such crude calculations.","309":"The actual impact of a small comet or asteroid with the Moon might make amomentary explosion sufficiently bright to be visible from the Earth. We can imagine ourancestors gazing idly up on some night a hundred thousand years ago and noting a strangecloud arising from the unilluminated part of the Moon, suddenly struck by the Sun\u2019s rays.But we would not expect such an event to have happened in historical times. The oddsagainst it must be something like a hundred to one. Nevertheless, there is an historicalaccount which may in fact describe an impact on the Moon seen from Earth with the nakedeye: On the evening of June 25, 1178, five British monks reported something extraordinary,which was later recorded in the chronicle of Gervase of Canterbury, generally considered areliable reporter on the political and cultural events of his time, after he had interviewed theeyewitnesses who asserted, under oath, the truth of their story. The chronicle reads:","310":"There was a bright New Moon, and as usual in that phase its horns were tiltedtowards the east. Suddenly, the upper horn split in two. From the midpoint of thedivision, a flaming torch sprang up, spewing out fire, hot coals, and sparks.","311":"The astronomers Derral Mulholland and Odile Calame have calculated that a lunarimpact would produce a dust cloud rising off the surface of the Moon with an appearancecorresponding rather closely to the report of the Canterbury monks.","312":"If such an impact were made only 800 years ago, the crater should still be visible.Erosion on the Moon is so inefficient, because of the absence of air and water, that evensmall craters a few billion years old are still comparatively well preserved. From thedescription recorded by Gervase, it is possible to pinpoint the sector of the Moon to whichthe observations refer. Impacts produce rays, linear trails of fine powder spewed out duringthe explosion. Such rays are associated with the very youngest craters on the Moon - forexample, those named after Aristarchus and Copernicus and Kepler. But while the cratersmay withstand erosion on the Moon, the rays, being exceptionally thin, do not. As timegoes on, even the arrival of micrometeorites - fine dust from space stirs up and covers overthe rays, and they gradually disappear. Thus rays are a signature of a recent impact.","313":"The meteoriticist Jack Hartung has pointed out that a very recent, very fresh-lookingsmall crater with a prominent ray system lies exactly in the region of the Moon referred toby the Canterbury monks. It is called Giordano Bruno after the sixteenth-century RomanCatholic scholar who held that there are an infinity of worlds and that many are inhabited.For this and other crimes he was burned at the stake in the year 1600.","314":"Another line of evidence consistent with this interpretation has been provided byCalame and Mulholland. When an object impacts the Moon at high speed, it sets the Moonslightly wobbling. Eventually the vibrations die down but not in so short a period as eighthundred years. Such a quivering can be studied by laser reflection techniques. The Apolloastronauts emplaced in several locales on the Moon special mirrors called laserretro-reflectors. When a laser beam from Earth strikes the mirror and bounces back, theround-trip travel time can be measured with remarkable precision. This time multiplied bythe speed of light gives us the distance to the Moon at that moment to equally remarkableprecision. Such measurements, performed over a period of years, reveal the Moon to belibrating, or quivering with a period (about three years) and amplitude (about three meters),consistent with the idea that the crater Giordano Bruno was gouged out less than a thousandyears ago.","315":"All this evidence is inferential and indirect. The odds, as I have said, are againstsuch an event happening in historical times. But the evidence is at least suggestive. As theTunguska Event and Meteor Crater, Arizona, also remind us, not all impact catastrophesoccurred in the early history of the solar system. But the fact that only a few of the lunarcraters have extensive ray systems also reminds us that, even on the Moon, some erosionoccurs.* By noting which craters overlap which and other signs of lunar stratigraphy, wecan reconstruct the sequence of impact and flooding events of which the production ofcrater Bruno is perhaps the most recent example.","316":"* On Mars, where erosion is much more efficient, although there are many craters there are virtually","317":"no ray craters, as we would expect.","318":"The Earth is very near the Moon. If the Moon is so severely cratered by impacts,how has the Earth avoided them? Why is Meteor Crater so rare? Do the comets andasteroids think it inadvisable to impact an inhabited planet? This is an unlikely forbearance.The only possible explanation is that impact craters are formed at very similar rates on boththe Earth and the Moon, but that on the airless, waterless Moon they are preserved forimmense periods of time, while on the Earth slow erosion wipes them out or fills them in.Running water, windblown sand and mountain-building are very slow processes. But overmillions or billions of years, they are capable of utterly erasing even very large impactscars.","319":"On the surface of any moon or planet, there will be external processes, such asimpacts from space, and internal processes, such as earthquakes; there will be fast,catastrophic events, such as volcanic explosions, and processes of excruciating slowness,such as the pitting of a surface by tiny airborne sand grains. There is no general answer tothe question of which processes dominate, the outside ones or the inside ones; the rare butviolent events, or the common and inconspicuous occurrences. On the Moon, the outside,catastrophic events hold sway; on Earth, the inside, slow processes dominate. Mars is anintermediate case.","320":"Between the orbits of Mars and Jupiter are countless asteroids, tiny terrestrialplanets. The largest are a few hundred kilometers across. Many have oblong shapes and aretumbling through space. In some cases there seem to be two or more asteroids in tightmutual orbits. Collisions among the asteroids happen frequently, and occasionally a piece ischipped off and accidentally intercepts the Earth, falling to the ground as a meteorite. In theexhibits, on the shelves of our museums are the fragments of distant worlds. The asteroidbelt is a great grinding mill, producing smaller and smaller pieces down to motes of dust.The bigger asteroidal pieces, along with the comets, are mainly responsible for the recentcraters on planetary surfaces. The asteroid belt may be a place where a planet was onceprevented from forming because of the gravitational tides of the giant nearby planet Jupiter;or it may be the shattered remains of a planet that blew itself up. This seems improbablebecause no scientist on Earth knows how a planet might blow itself up, which is probablyjust as well.","321":"The rings of Saturn bear some resemblance to the asteroid belt: trillions of tiny icymoonlets orbiting the planet. They may represent debris prevented by the gravity of Saturnfrom accreting into a nearby moon, or they may be the remains of a moon that wanderedtoo close and was torn apart by the gravitational tides. Alternatively, they may be the steadystate equilibrium between material ejected from a moon of Saturn, such as Titan, andmaterial falling into the atmosphere of the planet. Jupiter and Uranus also have ringsystems, discovered only recently, and almost invisible from the Earth. Whether Neptunehas a ring is a problem high on the agenda of planetary scientists. Rings may be a typicaladornment of Jovian-type planets throughout the cosmos.","322":"Major recent collisions from Saturn to Venus were alleged in a popular book,","323":"Worlds in Collision, published in 1950 by a psychiatrist named Immanuel Velikovsky. Heproposed that an object of planetary mass, which he called a comet, was somehow","324":"generated in the Jupiter system. Some 3,500 years ago, it careered in toward the inner solarsystem and made repeated encounters with the Earth and Mars, having as incidentalconsequences the parting of the Red Sea, allowing Moses and the Israelites to escape fromPharaoh, and the stopping of the Earth from rotating on Joshua\u2019s command. It also caused,he said, extensive vulcanism and floods.* Velikovsky imagined the comet, after acomplicated game of interplanetary billiards, to settle down into a stable, nearly circularorbit, becoming the planet Venus - which he claimed never existed before then.","325":"* As far as I know, the first essentially nonmystical attempt to explain a historical event by cometaryintervention was Edmund Halley\u2019s proposal that the Noachic flood was \u2018the casual Choc [shock] of a Comet.\u2019","326":"As I have discussed at some length elsewhere, these ideas are almost certainlywrong. Astronomers do not object to the idea of major collisions, only to major recentcollisions. In any model of the solar system it is impossible to show the sizes of the planetson the same scale as their orbits, because the planets would then be almost too small to see.If the planets were really shown to scale, as grains of dust, we would easily note that thechance of collision of a particular comet with the Earth in a few thousand years isextraordinarily low. Moreover, Venus is a rocky and metallic, hydrogen-poor planet,whereas Jupiter - where Velikovsky supposed it comes from - is made almost entirely ofhydrogen. There are no energy sources for comets or planets to be ejected by Jupiter. If onepassed by the Earth, it could not \u2018stop\u2019 the Earth\u2019s rotation, much less start it up again attwenty-four hours a day. No geological evidence supports the idea of an unusual frequencyof vulcanism or floods 3,500 years ago. There are Mesopotamian inscriptions referring toVenus that predate the time when Velikovsky says Venus changed from a comet into aplanet.* It is very unlikely that an object in such a highly elliptical orbit could be rapidlymoved into the nearly perfectly circular orbit of present-day Venus. And so on.","327":"* The Adda cylinder seal, dating from the middle of the third millennium B.C., prominently displaysInanna, the goddess of Venus, the morning star, and precursor of the Babylonian Ishtar.","328":"Many hypotheses proposed by scientists as well as by non-scientists turn out to bewrong. But science is a self-correcting enterprise. To be accepted, all new ideas mustsurvive rigorous standards of evidence. The worst aspect of the Velikovsky affair is not thathis hypotheses were wrong or in contradiction to firmly established facts, but that somewho called themselves scientists attempted to suppress Velikovsky\u2019s work. Science isgenerated by and devoted to free inquiry: the idea that any hypothesis, no matter howstrange, deserves to be considered on its merits. The suppression of uncomfortable ideasmay be common in religion and politics, but it is not the path to knowledge; it has no placein the endeavor of science. We do not know in advance who will discover fundamental newinsights.","329":"Venus has almost the same mass,* size, and density as the Earth. As the nearestplanet, it has for centuries been thought of as the Earth\u2019s sister. What is our sister planetreally like? Might it be a balmy, summer planet, a little warmer than the Earth because it isa little closer to the Sun? Does it have impact craters, or have they all eroded away? Are","330":"there volcanoes? Mountains? Oceans? Life?","331":"* It is, incidentally, some 30 million times more massive than the most massive comet known.","332":"The first person to look at Venus through the telescope was Galileo in 1609. He sawan absolutely featureless disc. Galileo noted that it went through phases, like the Moon,from a thin crescent to a full disc, and for the same reason: we are sometimes lookingmostly at the night side of Venus and sometimes mostly at the day side, a finding thatincidentally reinforced the view that the Earth went around the Sun and not vice versa. Asoptical telescopes became larger and their resolution (or ability to discriminate fine detail)improved, they were systematically turned toward Venus. But they did no better thanGalileo\u2019s. Venus was evidently covered by a dense layer of obscuring cloud. When we lookat the planet in the morning or evening skies, we are seeing sunlight reflected off the cloudsof Venus. But for centuries after their discovery, the composition of those clouds remainedentirely unknown.","333":"The absence of anything to see on Venus led some scientists to the curiousconclusion that the surface was a swamp, like the Earth in the Carboniferous Period. Theargument - if we can dignify it by such a word - went something like this:","334":"\u2018I can\u2019t see a thing on Venus.\u2019","335":"\u2018Why not?\u2019","336":"\u2018Because it\u2019s totally covered with clouds.\u2019","337":"\u2018What are clouds made of?\u2019","338":"\u2018Water, of course.\u2019","339":"\u2018Then why are the clouds of Venus thicker than the clouds on Earth?\u2019","340":"\u2018Because there\u2019s more water there.\u2019","341":"\u2018But if there is more water in the clouds, there must be more water on the surface.","342":"What kind of surfaces are very wet?\u2019","343":"\u2018Swamps.\u2019","344":"And if there are swamps, why not cyacads and dragonflies and perhaps even dinosaurs onVenus? Observation: There was absolutely nothing to see on Venus. Conclusion: It must becovered with life. The featureless clouds of Venus reflected our own predispositions. Weare alive, and we resonate with the idea of life elsewhere. But only careful accumulationand assessment of the evidence can tell us whether a given world is inhabited. Venus turnsout not to oblige our predispositions.","345":"The first real clue to the nature of Venus came from work with a prism made ofglass or a flat surface, called a diffraction grating, covered with fine, regularly spaced, ruledlines. When an intense beam of ordinary white light passes through a narrow slit and thenthrough a prism or grating, it is spread into a rainbow of colors called a spectrum. Thespectrum runs from high frequencies* of visible light to low ones - violet, blue, green,yellow, orange and red. Since we see these colors, it is called the spectrum of visible light.But there is far more light than the small segment of the spectrum we can see. At higher","346":"frequencies, beyond the violet, is a part of the spectrum called the ultraviolet: a perfectlyreal kind of light, carrying death to the microbes. It is invisible to us, but readily detectableby bumblebees and photoelectric cells. There is much more to the world than we can see.Beyond the ultraviolet is the X-ray part of the spectrum, and beyond the X-rays are thegamma rays. At lower frequencies, on the other side of red, is the infrared part of thespectrum. It was first discovered by placing a sensitive thermometer in what to our eyes isthe dark beyond the red. The temperature rose. There was light falling on the thermometereven though it was invisible to our eyes. Rattlesnakes and doped semiconductors detectinfrared radiation perfectly well. Beyond the infrared is the vast spectral region of the radiowaves. From gamma rays to radio waves, all are equally respectable brands of light. All areuseful in astronomy. But because of the limitations of our eyes, we have a prejudice, a bias,toward that tiny rainbow band we call the spectrum of visible light.","347":"* Light is a wave motion; its frequency is the number of wave crests, say, entering a detectioninstrument, such as a retina, in a given unit of time, such as a second.

He chose the composition of distant stars andplanets. We would never physically visit them, he thought, and with no sample in hand itseemed we would forever be denied knowledge of their composition. But only three yearsafter Comte\u2019s death, it was discovered that a spectrum can be used to determine thechemistry of distant objects. Different molecules and chemical elements absorb differentfrequencies or colors of light, sometimes in the visible and sometimes elsewhere in thespectrum. In the spectrum of a planetary atmosphere, a single dark line represents an imageof the slit in which light is missing, the absorption of sunlight during its brief passage","369":"through the air of another world. Each such line is made by a particular kind of molecule oratom. Every substance has its characteristic spectral signature. The gases on Venus can beidentified from the Earth, 60 million kilometers away. We can divine the composition ofthe Sun (in which helium, named after the Greek sun god Helios, was first found); ofmagnetic A stars rich in europium; of distant galaxies analyzed through the collective lightof a hundred billion constituent stars. Astronomical spectroscopy is an almost magicaltechnique. It amazes me still. Auguste Comte picked a particularly unfortunate example.","370":"If Venus were soaking wet, it should be easy to see the water vapor lines in itsspectrum. But the first spectroscopic searches, attempted at Mount Wilson Observatoryaround 1920, found not a hint, not a trace, of water vapor above the clouds of Venus,suggesting an arid, desert-like surface, surmounted by clouds of fine drifting silicate dust.Further study revealed enormous quantities of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, implyingto some scientists that all the water on the planet had combined with hydrocarbons to formcarbon dioxide, and that therefore the surface of Venus was a global oil field, a planet-widesea of petroleum. Others concluded that there was no water vapor above the clouds becausethe clouds were very cold, that all the water had condensed out into water droplets, whichdo not have the same pattern of spectral lines as water vapor. They suggested that the planetwas totally covered with water - except perhaps for an occasional limestone-encrustedisland, like the cliffs of Dover. But because of the vast quantities of carbon dioxide in theatmosphere, the sea could not be ordinary water; physical chemistry required carbonatedwater. Venus, they proposed, had a vast ocean of seltzer.","371":"The first hint of the true situation came not from spectroscopic studies in the visibleor near-infrared parts of the spectrum, but rather from the radio region. A radio telescopeworks more like a light meter than a camera. You point it toward some fairly broad regionof the sky, and it records how much energy, in a particular radio frequency, is coming downto Earth. We are used to radio signals transmitted by some varieties of intelligent life -namely, those who run radio and television stations. But there are many other reasons fornatural objects to give off radio waves. One is that they are hot. And when, in 1956, anearly radio telescope was turned toward Venus, it was discovered to be emitting radiowaves as if it were at an extremely high temperature. But the real demonstration that thesurface of Venus is astonishingly hot came when the Soviet spacecraft of the Venera seriesfirst penetrated the obscuring clouds and landed on the mysterious and inaccessible surfaceof the nearest planet. Venus, it turns out, is broiling hot. There are no swamps, no oil fields,no seltzer oceans. With insufficient data, it is easy to go wrong.","372":"When I greet a friend, I am seeing her in reflected visible light, generated by theSun, say, or by an incandescent lamp. The light rays bounce off my friend and into my eye.But the ancients, including no less a figure than Euclid, believed that we see by virtue ofrays somehow emitted by the eye and tangibly, actively contacting the object observed.","373":"This is a natural notion and can still be encountered, although it does not account for theinvisibility of objects in a darkened room. Today we combine a laser and a photocell, or aradar transmitter and a radio telescope, and in this way make active contact by light withdistant objects. In radar astronomy, radio waves are transmitted by a telescope on Earth,strike, say, that hemisphere of Venus that happens to be facing the Earth, and bounce back.At many wavelengths the clouds and atmosphere of Venus are entirely transparent to radio","374":"waves. Some places on the surface will absorb them or, if they are very rough, will scatterthem sideways and so will appear dark to radio waves. By following the surface featuresmoving with Venus as it rotates, it was possible for the first time to determine reliably thelength of its day - how long it takes Venus to spin once on its axis. It turns out that, withrespect to the stars, Venus turns once every 243 Earth days, but backwards, in the oppositedirection from all other planets in the inner solar system. As a result, the Sun rises in thewest and sets in the east, taking 118 Earth days from sunrise to sunrise. What is more, itpresents almost exactly the same face to the Earth each time it is closest to our planet.However the Earth\u2019s gravity has managed to nudge Venus into this Earth-locked rotationrate, it cannot have happened rapidly. Venus could not be a mere few thousand years oldbut, rather, it must be as old as all the other objects in the inner solar system.","375":"Radar pictures of Venus have been obtained, some from ground-based radartelescopes, some from the Pioneer Venus vehicle in orbit around the planet. They showprovocative evidence of impact craters. There are just as many craters that are not too bigor too small on Venus as there are in the lunar highlands, so many that Venus is againtelling us that it is very old. But the craters of Venus are remarkably shallow, almost as ifthe high surface temperatures have produced a kind of rock that flows over long periods oftime, like taffy or putty, gradually softening the relief. There are great mesas here, twice ashigh as the Tibetan plateau, an immense rift valley, possibly giant volcanoes and amountain as high as Everest. We now see before us a world previously hidden entirely byclouds - its features first explored by radar and by space vehicles.","376":"The surface temperatures on Venus, as deduced from radio astronomy andconfirmed by direct spacecraft measurements are around 480\u00b0C or 900\u00b0F, hotter than thehottest household oven. The corresponding surface pressure is 90 atmospheres, 90 times thepressure we feel from the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, the equivalent of the weight of water 1kilometer below the surface of the oceans. To survive for long on Venus, a space vehiclewould have to be refrigerated as well as built like a deep submersible.","377":"Something like a dozen space vehicles from the Soviet Union and United Stateshave entered the dense Venus atmosphere, and penetrated the clouds; a few of them haveactually survived for an hour or so on the surface.* Two spacecraft in the Soviet Veneraseries have taken pictures down there. Let us follow in the footsteps of these pioneeringmissions, and visit another world.","378":"* Pioneer Venus was a successful US mission in 1978-79, combining an orbiter and fouratmospheric entry probes, two of which briefly survived the inclemencies of the Venus surface. There aremany unexpected developments in mustering spacecraft to explore the planets. This is one of them: Amongthe instruments aboard one of the Pioneer Venus entry probes was a net flux radiometer, designed to measuresimultaneously the amount of infrared energy flowing upwards and downwards at each position in the Venusatmosphere. The instrument required a sturdy window that was also transparent to infrared radiation. A13. 5 -karat diamond was imported and milled into the desired window. However, the contractor was requiredto pay a $12,000 import duty. Eventually, the US Customs service decided that after the diamond waslaunched to Venus it was unavailable for trade on Earth and refunded the money to the manufacturer.","379":"In ordinary visible light, the faintly yellowish clouds of Venus can be made out, butthey show, as Galileo first noted, virtually no features at all. If the cameras look in the","380":"ultraviolet, however, we see a graceful, complex swirling weather system in the highatmosphere, where the winds are around 100 meters per second, some 220 miles per hour.The atmosphere of Venus is composed of 96 percent carbon dioxide. There are small tracesof nitrogen, water vapor, argon, carbon monoxide and other gases, but the onlyhydrocarbons or carbohydrates present are there in less than 0.1 parts per million. Theclouds of Venus turn out to be chiefly a concentrated solution of sulfuric acid. Smallquantities of hydrochloric acid and hydrofluoric acid are also present. Even at its high, coolclouds, Venus turns out to be a thoroughly nasty place.","381":"High above the visible cloud deck, at about 70 kilometers altitude, there is acontinuous haze of small particles. At 60 kilometers, we plunge into the clouds, and findourselves surrounded by droplets of concentrated sulfuric acid. As we go deeper, the cloudparticles tend to get bigger. The pungent gas, sulfur dioxide, SO 2 , is present in traceamounts in the lower atmosphere. It is circulated up above the clouds, broken down byultraviolet light from the Sun and recombined with water there to form sulfuric acid - whichcondenses into droplets, settles, and at lower altitudes is broken down by heat into SO 2 andwater again, completing the cycle. It is always raining sulfuric acid on Venus, all over theplanet, and not a drop ever reaches the surface.","382":"The sulfur-colored mist extends downwards to some 45 kilometers above thesurface of Venus, where we emerge into a dense but crystal-clear atmosphere. Theatmospheric pressure is so high, however, that we cannot see the surface. Sunlight isbounced about by atmospheric molecules until we lose all images from the surface. There isno dust here, no clouds, just an atmosphere getting palpably denser. Plenty of sunlight istransmitted by the overlying clouds, about as much as on an overcast day on the Earth.","383":"With searing heat, crushing pressures, noxious gases and everything suffused in aneerie, reddish glow, Venus seems less the goddess of love than the incarnation of hell. Asnearly as we can make out, at least some places on the surface are strewn fields of jumbled,softened irregular rocks, a hostile, barren landscape relieved only here and there by theeroded remnants of a derelict spacecraft from a distant planet, utterly invisible through thethick, cloudy, poisonous atmosphere.*","384":"* In this stifling landscape, there is not likely to be anything alive, even creatures very different fromus. Organic and other conceivable biological molecules would simply fall to pieces. But, as an indulgence, letus imagine that intelligent life once evolved on such a planet. Would it then invent science? The developmentof science on Earth was spurred fundamentally by observations of the regularities of the stars and planets. ButVenus is completely cloud-covered. The night is pleasingly long - about 59 Earth days long - but nothing ofthe astronomical universe would be visible if you looked up into the night sky of Venus. Even the Sun wouldbe invisible in the daytime; its light would be scattered and diffused over the whole sky - just as scuba diverssee only a uniform enveloping radiance beneath the sea. If a radio telescope were built on Venus, it coulddetect the Sun, the Earth and other distant objects. If astrophysics developed, the existence of stars couldeventually be deduced from the principles of physics, but they would be theoretical constructs only. Isometimes wonder what their reaction would be if intelligent beings on Venus one day learned to fly, to sailin the dense air, to penetrate the mysterious cloud veil 45 kilometers above them and eventually to emerge outthe top of the clouds, to look up and for the first time witness that glorious universe of Sun and planets andstars.","385":"Venus is a kind of planet-wide catastrophe. It now seems reasonably clear that the","386":"high surface temperature comes about through a massive greenhouse effect. Sunlight passesthrough the atmosphere and clouds of Venus, which are semi-transparent to visible light,and reaches the surface. The surface being heated endeavors to radiate back into space. Butbecause Venus is much cooler than the Sun, it emits radiation chiefly in the infrared ratherthan the visible region of the spectrum. However, the carbon dioxide and water vapor* inthe Venus atmosphere are almost perfectly opaque to infrared radiation, the heat of the Sunis efficiently trapped, and the surface temperature rises - until the little amount of infraredradiation that trickles out of this massive atmosphere just balances the sunlight absorbed inthe lower atmosphere and surface.","387":"* At the present time there is still a little uncertainty about the abundance of water vapor on Venus.The gas chromatograph on the Pioneer Venus entry probes gave an abundance of water in the loweratmosphere of a few tenths of a percent. On the other hand, infrared measurements by the Soviet entryvehicles, Veneras 1 1 and 12, gave an abundance of about a hundredth of a percent. If the former value applies,then carbon dioxide and water vapor alone are adequate to seal in almost all the heat radiation from thesurface and keep the Venus ground temperature at about 480\u00b0C. If the latter number applies - and my guess isthat it is the more reliable estimate - then carbon dioxide and water vapor alone are adequate to keep thesurface temperature only at about 380\u00b0C, and some other atmospheric constituent is necessary to close theremaining infrared frequency windows in the atmospheric greenhouse. However, the small quantities of S0 2 ,CO and HC1, all of which have been detected in the Venus atmosphere, seem adequate for this purpose. Thusrecent American and Soviet missions to Venus seem to have provided verification that the greenhouse effect","388":"is indeed the reason for the high surface temperature.","389":"Our neighboring world turns out to be a dismally unpleasant place. But we will go back toVenus. It is fascinating in its own right. Many mythic heroes in Greek and Norsemythology, after all, made celebrated efforts to visit Hell. There is also much to be learnedabout our planet, a comparative Heaven, by comparing it with Hell.","390":"The Sphinx, half human, half lion, was constructed more than 5,500 years ago. Itsface was once crisp and cleanly rendered. It is now softened and blurred by thousands ofyears of Egyptian desert sandblasting and by occasional rains. In New York City there is anobelisk called Cleopatra\u2019s Needle, which came from Egypt. In only about a hundred yearsin that city\u2019s Central Park, its inscriptions have been almost totally obliterated, because ofsmog and industrial pollution - chemical erosion like that in the atmosphere of Venus.Erosion on Earth slowly wipes out information, but because they are gradual - the patter ofa raindrop, the sting of a sand grain - those processes can be missed. Big structures, such asmountain ranges, survive tens of millions of years; smaller impact craters, perhaps ahundred thousand*; and large-scale human artifacts only some thousands. In addition tosuch slow and uniform erosion, destruction also occurs through catastrophes large andsmall. The Sphinx is missing a nose. Someone shot it off in a moment of idle desecration -some say it was Mameluke Turks, others, Napoleonic soldiers.","391":"* More precisely, an impact crater 10 kilometers in diameter is produced on the Earth about onceevery 500,000 years; it would survive erosion for about 300 million years in areas that are geologically stable,such as Europe and North America. Smaller craters are produced more frequently and destroyed more rapidly,especially in geologically active regions.","392":"On Venus, on Earth and elsewhere in the solar system, there is evidence forcatastrophic destruction, tempered or overwhelmed by slower, more uniform processes: onthe Earth, for example, rainfall, coursing into rivulets, streams and rivers of running water,creating huge alluvial basins; on Mars, the remnants of ancient rivers, perhaps arising frombeneath the ground; on Io, a moon of Jupiter, what seem to be broad channels made byflowing liquid sulfur. There are mighty weather systems on the Earth - and in the highatmosphere of Venus and on Jupiter. There are sandstorms on the Earth and on Mars;lightning on Jupiter and Venus and Earth. Volcanoes inject debris into the atmospheres ofthe Earth and Io. Internal geological processes slowly deform the surfaces of Venus, Mars,Ganymede and Europa, as well as Earth. Glaciers, proverbial for their slowness, producemajor reworkings of landscapes on the Earth and probably also on Mars. These processesneed not be constant in time. Most of Europe was once covered with ice. A few millionyears ago, the present site of the city of Chicago was buried under three kilometers of frost.On Mars, and elsewhere in the solar system, we see features that could not be producedtoday, landscapes carved hundreds of millions or billions of years ago when the planetaryclimate was probably very different.","393":"There is an additional factor that can alter the landscape and the climate of Earth:intelligent life, able to make major environmental changes. Like Venus, the Earth also has agreenhouse effect due to its carbon dioxide and water vapor. The global temperature of theEarth would be below the freezing point of water if not for the greenhouse effect. It keepsthe oceans liquid and life possible. A little greenhouse is a good thing. Like Venus, theEarth also has about 90 atmospheres of carbon dioxide; but it resides in the crust aslimestone and other carbonates, not in the atmosphere. If the Earth were moved only a littlecloser to the Sun, the temperature would increase slightly. This would drive some of theCO2 out of the surface rocks, generating a stronger greenhouse effect, which would in turnincrementally heat the surface further. A hotter surface would vaporize still morecarbonates into CO2, and there would be the possibility of a runaway greenhouse effect tovery high temperatures. This is just what we think happened in the early history of Venus,because of Venus\u2019s proximity to the Sun. The surface environment of Venus is a warning:something disastrous can happen to a planet rather like our own.","394":"The principal energy sources of our present industrial civilization are the so-calledfossil fuels. We burn wood and oil, coal and natural gas, and, in the process, release wastegases, principally CO2, into the air. Consequently, the carbon dioxide content of the Earth\u2019satmosphere is increasing dramatically. The possibility of a runaway greenhouse effectsuggests that we have to be careful: Even a one- or two-degree rise in the globaltemperature can have catastrophic consequences. In the burning of coal and oil and gasoline,we are also putting sulfuric acid into the atmosphere. Like Venus, our stratosphere evennow has a substantial mist of tiny sulfuric acid droplets. Our major cities are polluted withnoxious molecules. We do not understand the long-term effects of our course of action.","395":"But we have also been perturbing the climate in the opposite sense. For hundreds ofthousands of years human beings have been burning and cutting down forests andencouraging domestic animals to graze on and destroy grasslands. Slash- and-burnagriculture, industrial tropical deforestation and overgrazing are rampant today. But forestsare darker than grasslands, and grasslands are darker than deserts. As a consequence, the","396":"amount of sunlight that is absorbed by the ground has been declining, and by changes in theland use we are lowering the surface temperature of our planet. Might this cooling increasethe size of the polar ice cap, which, because it is bright, will reflect still more sunlight fromthe Earth, further cooling the planet, driving a runaway albedo* effect?","397":"* The albedo is the fraction of the sunlight striking a planet that is reflected back to space. Thealbedo of the Earth is some 30 to 35 percent. The rest of the sunlight is absorbed by the ground and isresponsible for the average surface temperature.","398":"Our lovely blue planet, the Earth, is the only home we know. Venus is too hot. Marsis too cold. But the Earth is just right, a heaven for humans. After all, we evolved here. Butour congenial climate may be unstable. We are perturbing our poor planet in serious andcontradictory ways. Is there any danger of driving the environment of the Earth toward theplanetary Hell of Venus or the global ice age of Mars? The simple answer is that nobodyknows. The study of the global climate, the comparison of the Earth with other worlds, aresubjects in their earliest stages of development. They are fields that are poorly andgrudgingly funded. In our ignorance, we continue to push and pull, to pollute theatmosphere and brighten the land, oblivious of the fact that the long-term consequences arelargely unknown.","399":"A few million years ago, when human beings first evolved on Earth, it was alreadya middle-aged world, 4.6 billion years along from the catastrophes and impetuosities of itsyouth. But we humans now represent a new and perhaps decisive factor. Our intelligenceand our technology have given us the power to affect the climate. How will we use thispower? Are we willing to tolerate ignorance and complacency in matters that affect theentire human family? Do we value short-term advantages above the welfare of the Earth?","400":"Or will we think on longer time scales, with concern for our children and our grandchildren,to understand and protect the complex life-support systems of our planet?

But despite thisconfession of ignorance, asserted with dogged persistence by an expert, no one paid anyheed, and from that time to this, we hear authoritative pronouncements by those who thinkthey have deduced life on Mars, and by those who think they have excluded it. Somepeople very much want there to be life on Mars; others very much want there to be no lifeon Mars. There have been excesses in both camps. These strong passions have somewhatfrayed the tolerance for ambiguity that is essential to science. There seem to be manypeople who simply wish to be told an answer, any answer, and thereby avoid the burden ofkeeping two mutually exclusive possibilities in their heads at the same time.

It ispossible that the infusoria under the microscope do the same.

It is curious torecall some of the mental habits of those departed days. At most, terrestrial menfancied there might be other men upon Mars, perhaps inferior to themselves andready to welcome a missionary enterprise.

G. Wells\u2019 1897 science fiction classic The War of the Worldsmaintain their haunting power to this day.* For all of our history, there has been the fear, orhope, that there might be life beyond the Earth. In the last hundred years, that premonitionhas focused on a bright red point of light in the night sky. Three years before The War ofthe Worlds was published, a Bostonian named Percival Lowell founded a majorobservatory where the most elaborate claims in support of life on Mars were developed.Lowell dabbled in astronomy as a young man, went to Harvard, secured a semi-officialdiplomatic appointment to Korea, and otherwise engaged in the usual pursuits of thewealthy. Before he died in 1916, he had made major contributions to our knowledge of thenature and evolution of the planets, to the deduction of the expanding universe and, in adecisive way, to the discovery of the planet Pluto, which is named after him. The first twoletters of the name Pluto are the initials of Percival Lowell. Its symbol is I, a planetarymonogram.","414":"* In 1938, a radio version, produced by Orson Welles, transposed the Martian invasion from Englandto the eastern United States, and frightened millions in war-jittery America into believing that the Martianswere in fact attacking.","415":"But Lowell\u2019s lifelong love was the planet Mars. He was electrified by theannouncement in 1877 by an Italian astronomer, Giovanni Schiaparelli, of canali on Mars.Schiaparelli had reported during a close approach of Mars to Earth an intricate network ofsingle and double straight lines crisscrossing the bright areas of the planet. Canali in Italianmeans channels or grooves, but was promptly translated into English as canals, a word thatimplies intelligent design. A Mars mania coursed through Europe and America, and Lowellfound himself swept up with it.","416":"In 1892, his eyesight failing, Schiaparelli announced he was giving up observingMars. Lowell resolved to continue the work. He wanted a first-rate observing site,undisturbed by clouds or city lights and marked by good \u2018seeing,\u2019 the astronomer\u2019s term fora steady atmosphere through which the shimmering of an astronomical image in thetelescope is minimized. Bad seeing is produced by small-scale turbulence in the atmosphereabove the telescope and is the reason the stars twinkle. Lowell built his observatory faraway from home, on Mars Hill in Flagstaff, Arizona.* He sketched the surface features ofMars, particularly the canals, which mesmerized him. Observations of this sort are not easy.You put in long hours at the telescope in the chill of the early morning. Often the seeing ispoor and the image of Mars blurs and distorts. Then you must ignore what you have seen.Occasionally the image steadies and the features of the planet flash out momentarily,marvelously. You must then remember what has been vouchsafed to you and accuratelycommit it to paper. You must put your preconceptions aside and with an open mind setdown the wonders of Mars.","417":"* Isaac Newton had written \u2018If the Theory of making Telescopes could at length be fully brought intopractice, yet there would be certain Bounds beyond which Telescopes could not perform. For the Air throughwhich we look upon the Stars, is in perpetual tremor . . . The only remedy is the most serene and quiet Air,such as may perhaps be found on the tops of the highest mountains above the grosser Clouds.\u2019","418":"Percival Lowell\u2019s notebooks are full of what he thought he saw: bright and darkareas, a hint of polar cap, and canals, a planet festooned with canals. Lowell believed hewas seeing a globe girdling network of great irrigation ditches, carrying water from themelting polar caps to the thirsty inhabitants of the equatorial cities. He believed the planetto be inhabited by an older and wiser race, perhaps very different from us. He believed thatthe seasonal changes in the dark areas were due to the growth and decay of vegetation. Hebelieved that Mars was, very closely, Earth-like. All in all, he believed too much.","419":"Lowell conjured up a Mars that was ancient, arid, withered, a desert world. Still, itwas an Earth-like desert. Lowell\u2019s Mars had many features in common with the AmericanSouthwest, where the Lowell Observatory was located. He imagined the Martiantemperatures a little on the chilly side but still as comfortable as \u2018the South of England.\u2019","420":"The air was thin, but there was enough oxygen to be breathable. Water was rare, but theelegant network of canals carried the life-giving fluid all over the planet.","421":"What was in retrospect the most serious contemporary challenge to Lowell\u2019s ideascame from an unlikely source. In 1907, Alfred Russel Wallace, co-discoverer of evolutionby natural selection, was asked to review one of Lowell\u2019s books. He had been an engineerin his youth and, while somewhat credulous on such issues as extrasensory perception, was","422":"admirably skeptical on the habitability of Mars. Wallace showed that Lowell had erred inhis calculation of the average temperatures on Mars; instead of being as temperate as theSouth of England, they were, with few exceptions, everywhere below the freezing point ofwater. There should be permafrost, a perpetually frozen subsurface. The air was muchthinner than Lowell had calculated. Craters should be as abundant as on the Moon. And asfor the water in the canals:","423":"Any attempt to make that scanty surplus [of water], by means of overflowing canals,travel across the equator into the opposite hemisphere, through such terrible desertregions and exposed to such a cloudless sky as Mr Lowell describes, would be thework of a body of madmen rather than of intelligent beings. It may be safelyasserted that not one drop of water would escape evaporation or insoak at even ahundred miles from its source.","424":"This devastating and largely correct physical analysis was written in Wallace\u2019seighty-fourth year. His conclusion was that life on Mars - by this he meant civil engineerswith an interest in hydraulics - was impossible. He offered no opinion on microorganisms.","425":"Despite Wallace\u2019s critique, despite the fact that other astronomers with telescopesand observing sites as good as Lowell\u2019s could find no sign of the fabled canals, Lowell\u2019svision of Mars gained popular acceptance. It had a mythic quality as old as Genesis. Part ofits appeal was the fact that the nineteenth century was an age of engineering marvels,including the construction of enormous canals: the Suez Canal, completed in 1869; theCorinth Canal, in 1893; the Panama Canal, in 1914; and, closer to home, the Great Lakelocks, the barge canals of upper New York State, and the irrigation canals of the AmericanSouthwest. If Europeans and Americans could perform such feats, why not Martians?","426":"Might there not be an even more elaborate effort by an older and wiser species,courageously battling the advance of desiccation on the red planet?","427":"We have now sent reconnaissance satellites into orbit around Mars. The entireplanet has been mapped. We have landed two automated laboratories on its surface. Themysteries of Mars have, if anything, deepened since Lowell\u2019s day. However, with picturesfar more detailed than any view of Mars that Lowell could have glimpsed, we have foundnot a tributary of the vaunted canal network, not one lock. Lowell and Schiaparelli andothers, doing visual observations under difficult seeing conditions, were misled - in partperhaps because of a predisposition to believe in life on Mars.","428":"The observing notebooks of Percival Lowell reflect a sustained effort at thetelescope over many years. They show Lowell to have been well aware of the skepticismexpressed by other astronomers about the reality of the canals. They reveal a manconvinced that he has made an important discovery and distressed that others have not yetunderstood its significance. In his notebook for 1905, for example, there is an entry onJanuary 21: \u2018Double canals came out by flashes, convincing of reality.\u2019 In reading Lowell\u2019snotebooks I have the distinct but uncomfortable feeling that he was really seeing something.But what?","429":"When Paul Pox of Cornell and I compared Lowell\u2019s maps of Mars with the Mariner","430":"9 orbital imagery sometimes with a resolution a thousand times superior to that of Lowell\u2019sEarthbound twenty-four-inch refracting telescope - we found virtually no correlation at all.","431":"It was not that Lowell\u2019s eye had strung up disconnected fine detail on the Martian surfaceinto illusory straight lines. There was no dark mottling or crater chains in the position ofmost of his canals. There were no features there at all. Then how could he have drawn thesame canals year after year? How could other astronomers some of whom said they had notexamined Lowell\u2019s maps closely until after their own observations - have drawn the samecanals? One of the great findings of the Mariner 9 mission to Mars was that there aretime-variable streaks and splotches on the Martian surface - many connected with theramparts of impact craters - which change with the seasons. They are due to windblowndust, the patterns varying with the seasonal winds. But the streaks do not have the characterof the canals, they are not in the position of the canals, and none of them is large enoughindividually to be seen from the Earth in the first place. It is unlikely that there were realfeatures on Mars even slightly resembling Lowell\u2019s canals in the first few decades of thiscentury that have disappeared without a trace as soon as close-up spacecraft investigationsbecame possible.","432":"The canals of Mars seem to be some malfunction, under difficult seeing conditions,of the human hand\/eye\/brain combination (or at least for some humans; many otherastronomers, observing with equally good instruments in Lowell\u2019s time and after, claimedthere were no canals whatever). But this is hardly a comprehensive explanation, and I havethe nagging suspicion that some essential feature of the Martian canal problem still remainsundiscovered. Lowell always said that the regularity of the canals was an unmistakable signthat they were of intelligent origin. This is certainly true. The only unresolved question waswhich side of the telescope the intelligence was on.","433":"Lowell\u2019s Martians were benign and hopeful, even a little god-like, very differentfrom the malevolent menace posed by Wells and Welles in The War of the Worlds. Bothsets of ideas passed into the public imagination through Sunday supplements and sciencefiction. I can remember as a child reading with breathless fascination the Mars novels ofEdgar Rice Burroughs. I journeyed with John Carter, gentleman adventurer from Virginia,to \u2018Barsoom,\u2019 as Mars was known to its inhabitants. I followed herds of eight-legged beastsof burden, the thoats. I won the hand of the lovely Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium. Ibefriended a four-meter-high green fighting man named Tars Tarkas. I wandered within thespired cities and domed pumping stations of Barsoom, and along the verdant banks of theNilosyrtis and Nepenthes canals.","434":"Might it really be possible - in fact and not fancy - to venture with John Carter tothe Kingdom of Helium on the planet Mars? Could we venture out on a summer evening,our way illuminated by the two hurtling moons of Barsoom, for a journey of high scientificadventure? Even if all Lowell\u2019s conclusions about Mars, including the existence of thefabled canals, turned out to be bankrupt, his depiction of the planet had at least this virtue:it aroused generations of eight-year-olds, myself among them, to consider the explorationof the planets as a real possibility, to wonder if we ourselves might one day voyage to Mars.John Carter got there by standing in an open field, spreading his hands and wishing. I canremember spending many an hour in my boyhood, arms resolutely outstretched in an emptyfield, imploring what I believed to be Mars to transport me there. It never worked. There","435":"had to be some other way.","436":"Like organisms, machines also have their evolutions. The rocket began, like thegunpowder that first powered it, in China where it was used for ceremonial and aestheticpurposes. Imported to Europe around the fourteenth century, it was applied to warfare,discussed in the late nineteenth century as a means of transportation to the planets by theRussian schoolteacher Konstantin Tsiolkovsky, and first developed seriously for highaltitude flight by the American scientist Robert Goddard. The German V-2 military rocketof World War II employed virtually all of Goddard\u2019s innovations and culminated in 1948 inthe two-stage launching of the V-2\/WAC Corporal combination to the then-unprecedentedaltitude of 400 kilometers. In the 1959s, engineering advances organized by Sergei Korolovin the Soviet Union and Wernher von Braun in the United States, funded as deliverysystems for weapons of mass destruction, led to the first artificial satellites. The pace ofprogress has continued to be brisk: manned orbital flight; humans orbiting, then landing onthe moon; and unmanned spacecraft outward bound throughout the solar system. Manyother nations have now launched spacecraft, including Britain, France, Canada, Japan andChina, the society that invented the rocket in the first place.","437":"Among the early applications of the space rocket, as Tsiolkovsky and Goddard(who as a young man had read Wells and had been stimulated by the lectures of PercivalLowell) delighted in imagining, were an orbiting scientific station to monitor the Earthfrom a great height and a probe to search for life on Mars. Both these dreams have nowbeen fulfilled.","438":"Imagine yourself a visitor from some other and quite alien planet, approachingEarth with no preconceptions. Your view of the planet improves as you come closer andmore and more fine detail stands out. Is the planet inhabited? At what point can youdecide? If there are intelligent beings, perhaps they have created engineering structures thathave high-contrast components on a scale of a few kilometers, structures detectable whenour optical systems and distance from the Earth provide kilometer resolution. Yet at thislevel of detail, the earth seems utterly barren. There is no sign of life, intelligent orotherwise, in places we call Washington, New York, Boston, Moscow, London, Paris,Berlin, Tokyo and Peking. If there are intelligent beings on Earth, they have not muchmodified the landscape into regular geometrical patterns at kilometer resolution.","439":"But when we improve the resolution tenfold, when we begin to see detail as smallas a hundred meters across, the situation changes. Many places on Earth seem suddenly tocrystallize out, revealing an intricate pattern of squares and rectangles, straight lines andcircles. These are, in fact, the engineering artifacts of intelligent beings: roads, highways,canals, farmland, city streets - a pattern disclosing the twin human passions for Euclideangeometry and territoriality. On this scale, intelligent life can be discerned in Boston andWashington and New York. And at ten-meter resolution, the degree to which the landscapehas been reworked first really becomes evident. Humans have been very busy. Thesephotos have been taken in daylight. But at twilight or during the night, other things arevisible: oil-well fires in Libya and the Persian Gulf; deepwater illumination by the Japanesesquid fishing fleet; the bright lights of large cities. And if, in daylight, we improve ourresolution so we can make out things that are a meter across, then we begin to detect for thefirst time individual organisms - whales, cows, flamingos, people.","440":"Intelligent life on Earth first reveals itself through the geometric regularity of itsconstructions. If Lowell\u2019s canal network really existed, the conclusion that intelligentbeings inhabit Mars might be similarly compelling. For life to be detected on Marsphotographically, even from Mars orbit, it must likewise have accomplished a majorreworking of the surface. Technical civilizations, canal builders, might be easy to detect.","441":"But except for one or two enigmatic features, nothing of the sort is apparent in the exquisiteprofusion of Martian surface detail uncovered by unmanned spacecraft. However, there aremany other possibilities, ranging from large plants and animals to microorganisms, toextinct forms, to a planet that is now and was always lifeless. Because Mars is farther fromthe Sun than is the Earth, its temperatures are considerably lower. Its air is thin, containingmostly carbon dioxide but also some molecular nitrogen and argon and very smallquantities of water vapor, oxygen and ozone. Open bodies of liquid water are impossibletoday because the atmospheric pressure on Mars is too low to keep even cold water fromrapidly boiling. There may be minute quantities of liquid water in pores and capillaries inthe soil. The amount of oxygen is far too little for a human being to breathe. The ozoneabundance is so small that germicidal ultraviolet radiation from the Sun strikes the Martiansurface unimpeded. Could any organism survive in such an environment?","442":"To test this question, many years ago my colleagues and I prepared chambers thatsimulated the Martian environment as it was then known, inoculated them with terrestrialmicroorganisms and waited to see if anybody survived. Such chambers are called, of course,Mars Jars. The Mars Jars cycled the temperatures within a typical Martian range from alittle above the freezing point around noon to about -80\u00b0C just before dawn, in an anoxicatmosphere composed chiefly of CCE and N 2 . Ultraviolet lamps reproduced the fierce solarflux. No liquid water was present except for very thin films wetting individual sand grains.Some microbes froze to death after the first night and were never heard from again. Othersgasped and perished from lack of oxygen. Some died of thirst, and some were fried by theultraviolet light. But there were always a fair number of varieties of terrestrial microbes thatdid not need oxygen; that temporarily closed up shop when the temperatures dropped toolow; that hid from the ultraviolet light under pebbles or thin layers of sand. In otherexperiments, when small quantities of liquid water were present, the microbes actuallygrew. If terrestrial microbes can survive the Martian environment, how much better Martianmicrobes, if they exist, must do on Mars. But first we must get there.","443":"The Soviet Union maintains an active program of unmanned planetary exploration.Every year or two the relative positions of the planets and the physics of Kepler andNewton permit the launch of a spacecraft to Mars or Venus with a minimum expenditure ofenergy. Since the early 1960\u2019s the U.S.S.R. has missed few such opportunities. Sovietpersistence and engineering skills have eventually paid off handsomely. Five Sovietspacecraft - Venera 8 through 12 - have landed on Venus and successfully returned datafrom the surface, no insignificant feat in so hot, dense and corrosive a planetary atmosphere.Yet despite many attempts, the Soviet Union has never landed successfully on Mars - aplace that, at least at first sight, seems more hospitable, with chilly temperatures, a muchthinner atmosphere and more benign gases; with polar ice caps, clear pink skies, great sanddunes, ancient river beds, a vast rift valley, the largest volcanic construct, so far as we know,in the solar system, and balmy equatorial summer afternoons. It is a far more Earth-like","444":"world than Venus.","445":"In 1971, the Soviet Mars 3 spacecraft entered the Martian atmosphere. According tothe information automatically radioed back, it successfully deployed its landing systemsduring entry, correctly oriented its ablation shield downward, properly unfurled its greatparachute and fired its retro-rockets near the end of its descent path. According to the datareturned by Mars 3, it should have landed successfully on the red planet. But after landing,the spacecraft returned a twenty-second fragment of a featureless television picture to Earthand then mysteriously failed. In 1973, a quite similar sequence of events occurred with theMars 6 lander, in that case the failure occurring within one second of touchdown. Whatwent wrong?","446":"The first illustration I ever saw of Mars 3 was on a Soviet postage stamp(denomination, 16 kopecks), which depicted the spacecraft descending through a kind ofpurple muck. The artist was trying, I think, to illustrate dust and high winds: Mars 3 hadentered the Martian atmosphere during an enormous global dust storm. We have evidencefrom the U.S. Mariner 9 mission that near- surface winds of more than 140 meters persecond - faster than half the speed of sound on Mars - arose in that storm. Both our Sovietcolleagues and we think it likely that these high winds caught the Mars 3 spacecraft withparachute unfurled, so that it landed gently in the vertical direction but with breakneckspeed in the horizontal direction. A spacecraft descending on the shrouds of a largeparachute is particularly vulnerable to horizontal winds. After landing, Mars 3 may havemade a few bounces, hit a boulder or other example of Martian relief, tipped over, lost theradio link with its carrier \u2018bus\u2019 and failed.","447":"But why did Mars 3 enter in the midst of a great dust storm? The Mars 3 missionwas rigidly organized before launch. Every step it was to perform was loaded into theon-board computer before it left earth. There was no opportunity to change the computerprogram, even as the extent of the great 1971 dust storm became clear. In the jargon ofspace exploration, the Mars 3 mission was preprogrammed, not adaptive. The failure ofMars 6 is more mysterious. There was no planet-wide storm when this spacecraft enteredthe Martian atmosphere, and no reason to suspect a local storm, as sometimes happens, atthe landing site. Perhaps there was an engineering failure just at the moment of touchdown.Or perhaps there is something particularly dangerous about the Martian surface.","448":"The combination of Soviet successes in landing on Venus and Soviet failures inlanding on Mars naturally caused us some concern about the U.S. Viking mission, whichhad been informally scheduled to set one of its two descent craft gently down on theMartian surface on the Bicentennial of the United States, July 4, 1976. Like its Sovietpredecessors, the Viking landing maneuver involved an ablation shield, a parachute andretro-rockets. Because the Martian atmosphere is only 1 percent as dense as the Earth\u2019s, avery large parachute, eighteen meters in diameter, was deployed to slow the spacecraft as itentered the thin air of Mars. The atmosphere is so thin that if Viking had landed at a highelevation there would not have been enough atmosphere to brake the descent adequately: itwould have crashed. One requirement, therefore, was for a landing site in a low-lyingregion. From Mariner 9 results and ground-based radar studies, we knew many such areas.","449":"To avoid the probable fate of Mars 3, we wanted Viking to land in a place and timeat which the winds were low. Winds that would make the lander crash were probably","450":"strong enough to lift dust off the surface. If we could check that the candidate landing sitewas not covered with shifting, drifting dust, we would have at least a fair chance ofguaranteeing that the winds were not intolerably high. This was one reason that eachViking lander was carried into Mars orbit with its orbiter, and descent delayed until theorbiter surveyed the landing site. We had discovered with Mariner 9 that characteristicchanges in the bright and dark patterns on the Martian surface occur during times of highwinds. We certainly would not have certified a Viking landing site as safe if orbitalphotographs had shown such shifting patterns. But our guarantees could not be 100 percentreliable. For example, we could imagine a landing site at which the winds were so strongthat all mobile dust had already been blown away. We would then have had no indicationof the high winds that might have been there. Detailed weather predictions for Mars were,of course, much less reliable than for Earth. (Indeed one of the many objectives of theViking mission was to improve our understanding of the weather on both planets.)","451":"Because of communication and temperature constraints, Viking could not land athigh Martian latitudes. Farther poleward than about 45 or 50 degrees in both hemispheres,either the time of useful communication of the spacecraft with the Earth or the periodduring which the spacecraft would avoid dangerously low temperatures would have beenawkwardly short.","452":"We did not wish to land in too rough a place. The spacecraft might have tipped overand crashed, or at the least its mechanical arm, intended to acquire Martian soil samples,might have become wedged or been left waving helplessly a meter too high above thesurface. Likewise, we did not want to land in places that were too soft. If the spacecraft\u2019sthree landing pods had sunk deeply into a loosely packed soil, various undesirableconsequences would have followed, including immobilization of the sample arm. But wedid not want to land in a place that was too hard either - had we landed in a vitreous lavafield, for example, with no powdery surface material, the mechanical arm would have beenunable to acquire the sample vital to the projected chemistry and biology experiments.","453":"The best photographs then available of Mars - from the Mariner 9 orbiter - showedfeatures no smaller than 90 meters (100 yards) across. The Viking orbiter picturesimproved this figure only slightly. Boulders one meter (three feet) in size were entirelyinvisible in such photographs, and could have had disastrous consequences for the Vikinglander. Likewise, a deep, soft powder might have been indetectable photographically.Fortunately, there was a technique that enabled us to determine the roughness or softness ofa candidate landing site: radar. A very rough place would scatter radar from Earth off to thesides of the beam and therefore appear poorly reflective, or radar-dark. A very soft placewould also appear poorly reflective because of the many interstices between individualsand grains. While we were unable to distinguish between rough places and soft places, wedid not need to make such distinctions for landing-site selection. Both, we knew, weredangerous. Preliminary radar surveys suggested that as much as a quarter to a third of thesurface area of Mars might be radar-dark, and therefore dangerous for Viking. But not all ofMars can be viewed by Earth-based radar - only a swath between about 25\u00b0 N and about25\u00b0 S. The Viking orbiter carried no radar system of its own to map the surface.","454":"There were many constraints - perhaps, we feared, too many. Our landing sites hadto be not too high, too windy, too hard, too soft, too rough or too close to the pole. It was","455":"remarkable that there were any places at all on Mars that simultaneously satisfied all oursafety criteria. But it was also clear that our search for safe harbors had led us to landingsites that were, by and large, dull.","456":"When each of the two Viking orbiter-lander combinations was inserted into Martianorbit, it was unalterably committed to landing at a certain latitude on Mars. If the low pointin the orbit was at 21\u00b0 Martian north latitude, the lander would touch down at 21\u00b0 N,although, by waiting for the planet to turn beneath it, it could land at any longitudewhatever. Thus the Viking science teams selected candidate latitudes for which there wasmore than one promising site. Viking 1 was targeted for 21\u00b0 N. The prime site was in aregion called Chryse (Greek for \u2018the land of gold\u2019), near the confluence of four sinuouschannels thought to have been carved in previous epochs of Martian history by runningwater. The Chryse site seemed to satisfy all safety criteria. But the radar observations hadbeen made nearby, not in the Chryse landing site itself. Radar observations of Chryse weremade for the first time - because of the geometry of Earth and Mars - only a few weeksbefore the nominal landing date.","457":"The candidate landing latitude for Viking 2 was 44\u00b0 N; the prime site, a localecalled Cydonia, chosen because, according to some theoretical arguments, there was asignificant chance of small quantities of liquid water there, at least at some time during theMartian year. Since the Viking biology experiments were strongly oriented towardorganisms that are comfortable in liquid water, some scientists held that the chance ofViking finding life would be substantially improved in Cydonia. On the other hand, it wasargued that, on so windy a planet as Mars, microorganisms should be everywhere if theyare anywhere. There seemed to be merit to both positions; and it was difficult to decidebetween them. What was quite clear, however, was that 44\u00b0 N was completely inaccessibleto radar site-certification; we had to accept a significant risk of failure with Viking 2 if itwas committed to high northern latitudes. It was sometimes argued that if Viking 1 wasdown and working well we could afford to accept a greater risk with Viking 2. 1 foundmyself making very conservative recommendations on the fate of a billion-dollar mission. Icould imagine, for example, a key instrument failure in Chryse just after an unfortunatecrash landing in Cydonia. To improve the Viking options, additional landing sites,geologically very different from Chryse and Cydonia, were selected in the radar-certifiedregion near 4\u00b0 S latitude. A decision on whether Viking 2 would set down at high or at lowlatitude was not made until virtually the last minute, when a place with the hopeful name ofUtopia, at the same latitude as Cydonia, was chosen.","458":"For Viking 1, the original landing site seemed, after we examined orbiterphotographs and late-breaking Earth-based radar data, unacceptably risky. For a while Iworried that Viking 1 had been condemned, like the legendary Flying Dutchman, to wanderthe skies of Mars forever, never to find safe haven. Eventually we found a suitable spot,still in Chryse but far from the confluence of the four ancient channels. The delay preventedus from setting down on July 4, 1976, but it was generally agreed that a crash landing onthat date would have been an unsatisfactory two hundredth birthday present for the UnitedStates. We deboosted from orbit and entered the Martian atmosphere sixteen days later.","459":"After an interplanetary voyage of a year and a half, covering a hundred millionkilometers the long way round the Sun, each orbiter\/lander combination was inserted into","460":"its proper orbit about Mars; the orbiters surveyed candidate landing sites; the landersentered the Martian atmosphere on radio command and correctly oriented ablation shields,deployed parachutes, divested coverings, and fired retro-rockets. In Chryse and Utopia, forthe first time in human history, spacecraft had touched down, gently and safely, on the redplanet. These triumphant landings were due in considerable part to the great skill investedin their design, fabrication and testing, and to the abilities of the spacecraft controllers. Butfor so dangerous and mysterious a planet as Mars, there was also at least an element ofluck.","461":"Immediately after landing, the first pictures were to be returned. We knew we hadchosen dull places. But we could hope. The first picture taken by the Viking 1 lander wasof one of its own footpads - in case it were to sink into Martian quicksand, we wanted toknow about it before the spacecraft disappeared. The picture built up, line by line, untilwith enormous relief we saw the footpad sitting high and dry above the Martian surface.Soon other pictures came into being, each picture element radioed individually back toEarth.","462":"I remember being transfixed by the first lander image to show the horizon of Mars.This was not an alien world, I thought. I knew places like it in Colorado and Arizona andNevada. There were rocks and sand drifts and a distant eminence, as natural andunselfconscious as any landscape on Earth. Mars was a place. I would, of course, have beensurprised to see a grizzled prospector emerge from behind a dune leading his mule, but atthe same time the idea seemed appropriate. Nothing remotely like it ever entered my mindin all the hours I spent examining the Venera 9 and 10 images of the Venus surface. Oneway or another, I knew, this was a world to which we would return.","463":"The landscape is stark and red and lovely: boulders thrown out in the creation of acrater somewhere over the horizon, small sand dunes, rocks that have been repeatedlycovered and uncovered by drifting dust, plumes of fine-grained material blown about by thewinds. Where did the rocks come from? How much sand has been blown by wind? Whatmust the previous history of the planet have been to create sheared rocks, buried boulders,polygonal gouges in the ground? What are the rocks made of? The same materials as thesand? Is the sand merely pulverized rock or something else? Why is the sky pink? What isthe air made of? How fast does the wind blow? Are there marsquakes? How does theatmospheric pressure and the appearance of the landscape change with the seasons?","464":"For every one of these questions Viking has provided definitive or at least plausibleanswers. The Mars revealed by the Viking mission is of enormous interest - particularlywhen we remember that the landing sites were chosen for their dullness. But the camerasrevealed no sign of canal builders, no Barsoomian aircars or short swords, no princesses orfighting men, no thoats, no footprints, not even a cactus or a kangaroo rat. For as far as wecould see, there was not a sign of life.*","465":"* There was a brief flurry when the uppercase letter B, a putative Martian graffito, seemed to bevisible on a small boulder in Chryse. But later analysis showed it to be a trick of light and shadow and thehuman talent for pattern recognition. It also seemed remarkable that the Martians should have tumbledindependently to the Latin alphabet. But there was just a moment when resounding in my head was the distantecho of a word from my boyhood - Barsoom.","466":"Perhaps there are large lifeforms on Mars, but not in our two landing sites. Perhapsthere are smaller forms in every rock and sand grain. For most of its history, those regionsof the Earth not covered by water looked rather like Mars today - with an atmosphere richin carbon dioxide, with ultraviolet light shining fiercely down on the surface through anatmosphere devoid of ozone. Large plants and animals did not colonize the land until thelast 10 percent of Earth history. And yet for three billion years there were microorganismseverywhere on Earth. To look for life on Mars, we must look for microbes.","467":"The Viking lander extends human capabilities to other and alien landscapes. Bysome standards, it is about as smart as a grasshopper; by others, only as intelligent as abacterium. There is nothing demeaning in these comparisons. It took nature hundreds ofmillions of years to evolve a bacterium, and billions to make a grasshopper. With only alittle experience in this sort of business, we are becoming fairly skillful at it. Viking hastwo eyes as we do, but they also work in the infrared, as ours do not; a sample arm that canpush rocks, dig and acquire soil samples; a kind of finger that it puts up to measure windspeed and direction; a nose and taste buds, of a sort, with which it senses, to a much higherprecision than we can, the presence of trace molecules; an interior ear with which it candetect the rumbling of marsquakes and the gentler wind-driven jiggling of the spacecraft;and a means of detecting microbes. The spacecraft has its own self-contained radioactivepower source. It radios all the scientific information it acquires back to Earth. It receivesinstructions from Earth, so human beings can ponder the significance of the Viking resultsand tell the spacecraft to do something new.","468":"But what is the optimum way, given severe constraints on size, cost and powerrequirements, to search for microbes on Mars? We cannot - at least as yet - sendmicrobiologists there. I once had a friend, an extraordinary microbiologist named WolfVishniac, of the University of Rochester, in New York. In the late 1950\u2019s, when we werejust beginning to think seriously about looking for life on Mars, he found himself at ascientific meeting where an astronomer expressed amazement that the biologists had nosimple, reliable, automated instrument capable of looking for microorganisms. Vishniacdecided he would do something about the matter.","469":"He developed a small device to be sent to the planets. His friends called it the WolfTrap. It would carry a little vial of nutrient organic matter to Mars, arrange for a sample ofMartian soil to be mixed in with it, and observe the changing turbidity or cloudiness ofliquid as the Martian bugs (if there were any) grew (if they would). The Wolf Trap wasselected along with three other microbiology experiments to go aboard the Viking landers.Two of the other three experiments also chose to send food to the Martians. The success ofthe Wolf Trap required that Martian bugs like liquid water. There were those who thoughtthat Vishniac would only drown the little Martians. But the advantage of the Wolf Trap wasthat it laid no requirements on what the Martian microbes must do with their food. Theyhad only to grow. All the other experiments made specific assumptions about gases thatwould be given off or taken in by the microbes, assumptions that were little more thanguesses.","470":"The National Aeronautics and Space Administration, which runs the United States","471":"planetary space program, is subject to frequent and unpredictable budget cuts. Only rarelyare there unanticipated budget increases. NASA scientific activities have very littleeffective support in the government, and so science is most often the target when moneyneeds to be taken away from NASA. In 1971 it was decided that one of the fourmicrobiology experiments must be removed, and the Wolf Trap was offloaded. It was acrushing disappointment for Vishniac, who had invested twelve years in its development.","472":"Many others in his place might have stalked off the Viking Biology Team. ButVishniac was a gentle and dedicated man. He decided instead that he could best serve thesearch for life on Mars by voyaging to the most Mars-like environment on Earth - the dryvalleys of Antarctica. Some previous investigators had examined Antarctic soil and decidedthat the few microbes they were able to find were not really natives of the dry valleys, buthad been blown there from other, more clement environments. Recalling the Mars Jarsexperiments, Vishniac believed that life was tenacious and that Antarctica was perfectlyconsistent with microbiology. If terrestrial bugs could live on Mars, he thought, why not inAntarctica - which was by and large warmer, wetter, and had more oxygen and much lessultraviolet light. Conversely, finding life in Antarctic dry valleys would correspondinglyimprove, he thought, the chances of life on Mars. Vishniac believed that the experimentaltechniques previously used to deduce no indigenous microbes in Antarctica were flawed.The nutrients, while suitable for the comfortable environment of a university microbiologylaboratory, were not designed for the arid polar wasteland.","473":"So on November 8, 1973, Vishniac, his new microbiology equipment and ageologist companion were transported by helicopter from McMurdo Station to an area nearMount Balder, a dry valley in the Asgard range. His practice was to implant the littlemicrobiology stations in the Antarctic soil and return about a month later to retrieve them.On December 10, 1973, he left to gather samples on Mount Balder; his departure wasphotographed from about three kilometers away. It was the last time anyone saw him alive.Eighteen hours later, his body was discovered at the base of a cliff of ice. He had wanderedinto an area not previously explored, had apparently slipped on the ice and tumbled andbounced for a distance of 150 meters. Perhaps something had caught his eye, a likelyhabitat for microbes, say, or a patch of green where none should be. We will never know.","474":"In the small brown notebook he was carrying that day, the last entry reads; \u2018Station 202retrieved. 10 December, 1973. 2230 hours. Soil temperature, -10\u00b0. Air temperature -16\u00b0.\u2019 Ithad been a typical summer temperature for Mars.","475":"Many of Vishniac\u2019s microbiology stations are still sitting in Antarctica. But thesamples that were returned were examined, using his methods, by his professionalcolleagues and friends. A wide variety of microbes, which would have been indetectablewith conventional scoring techniques, was found in essentially every site examined. A newspecies of yeast, apparently unique to Antarctica, was discovered in his samples by hiswidow, Helen Simpson Vishniac. Large rocks returned from Antarctica in that expedition,examined by Imre Friedmann, turn out to have a fascinating microbiology - one or twomillimeters inside the rock, algae have colonized a tiny world in which small quantities ofwater are trapped and made liquid. On Mars such a place would be even more interesting,because while the visible light necessary for photosynthesis would penetrate to that depth,the germicidal ultraviolet light would be at least partially attenuated.","476":"Because the design of space missions is finalized many years before launch, andbecause of Vishniac\u2019s death, the results of his Antarctic experiments did not influence theViking design for seeking Martian life. In general, the microbiology experiments were notcarried out at the low ambient Martian temperatures, and most did not provide longincubation times. They all made fairly strong assumptions about what Martian metabolismhad to be like. There was no way to look for life inside the rocks.","477":"Each Viking lander was equipped with a sample arm to acquire material from thesurface and then slowly withdraw it into the innards of the spacecraft, transporting theparticles on little hoppers like an electric train to five different experiments: one on theinorganic chemistry of the soil, another to look for organic molecules in the sand and dust,and three to look for microbial life. When we look for life on a planet, we are makingcertain assumptions. We try, as well as we can, not to assume that life elsewhere will bejust like life here. But there are limits to what we can do. We know in detail only about lifehere. While the Viking biology experiments are a pioneering first effort, they hardlyrepresent a definitive search for life on Mars. The results have been tantalizing, annoying,provocative, stimulating, and, at least until recently, substantially inconclusive.","478":"Each of the three microbiology experiments asked a different kind of question, butin all cases a question about Martian metabolism. If there are microorganisms in theMartian soil, they must take in food and give off waste gases; or they must take in gasesfrom the atmosphere and, perhaps with the aid of sunlight, convert them into usefulmaterials. So we bring food to Mars and hope that the Martians, if there are any, will find ittasty. Then we see if any interesting new gases come out of the soil. Or we provide our ownradioactively labeled gases and see if they are converted into organic matter, in which casesmall Martians are inferred.","479":"By criteria established before launch, two of the three Viking microbiologyexperiments seem to have yielded positive results. First, when Martian soil was mixed witha sterile organic soup from Earth, something in the soil chemically broke down the soup -almost as if there were respiring microbes metabolizing a food package from Earth. Second,when gases from Earth were introduced into the Martian soil sample, the gases becamechemically combined with the soil - almost as if there were photosynthesizing microbes,generating organic matter from atmospheric gases. Positive results in Martian microbiologywere achieved in seven different samplings- in two locales on Mars separated by 5,000kilometers.","480":"But the situation is complex, and the criteria of experimental success may have beeninadequate. Enormous efforts were made to build the Viking microbiology experiments andtest them with a variety of microbes. Very little effort was made to calibrate theexperiments with plausible inorganic Martian surface materials. Mars is not the Earth. Asthe legacy of Percival Lowell reminds us, we can be fooled. Perhaps there is an exoticinorganic chemistry in the Martian soil that is able by itself, in the absence of Martianmicrobes, to oxidize foodstuffs. Perhaps there is some special inorganic, nonliving catalystin the soil that is able to fix atmospheric gases and convert them into organic molecules.","481":"Recent experiments suggest that this may indeed be the case. In the great Martiandust storm of 1971, spectral features of the dust were obtained by the Mariner 9 infraredspectrometer. In analyzing these spectra, O. B. Toon, J. B. Pollack and I found that certain","482":"features seem best accounted for by montmorillonite and other kinds of clay. Subsequentobservations by the Viking lander support the identification of windblown clays on Mars.Now, A. Banin and J. Rishpon have found that they can reproduce some of the key features- those resembling photosynthesis as well as those resembling respiration of the\u2018successful\u2019 Viking microbiology experiments if in laboratory experiments they substitutesuch clays for the Martian soil. The clays have a complex active surface, given to absorbingand releasing gases and to catalyzing chemical reactions. It is too soon to say that all theViking microbiology results can be explained by inorganic chemistry, but such a resultwould no longer be surprising. The clay hypothesis hardly excludes life on Mars, but itcertainly carries us far enough to say that there is no compelling evidence for microbiologyon Mars.","483":"Even so, the results of Banin and Rishpon are of great biological importancebecause they show that in the absence of life there can be a kind of soil chemistry that doessome of the same things life does. On the Earth before life, there may already have beenchemical processes resembling respiration and photosynthesis cycling in the soil, perhapsto be incorporated by life once it arose. In addition, we know that montmorillonite clays area potent catalyst for combining amino acids into longer chain molecules resemblingproteins. The clays of the primitive Earth may have been the forge of life, and thechemistry of contemporary Mars may provide essential clues to the origin and early historyof life on our planet.","484":"The Martian surface exhibits many impact craters, each named after a person,usually a scientist. Crater Vishniac lies appropriately in the Antarctic region of Mars.Vishniac did not claim that there had to be life on Mars, merely that it was possible, andthat it was extraordinarily important to know if it was there. If life on Mars exists, we willhave a unique opportunity to test the generality of our form of fife. And if there is no life onMars, a planet rather like the Earth, we must understand why - because in that case, asVishniac stressed, we have the classic scientific confrontation of the experiment and thecontrol.","485":"The finding that the Viking microbiology results can be explained by clays, thatthey need not imply life, helps to resolve another mystery: the Viking organic chemistryexperiment showed not a hint of organic matter in the Martian soil. If there is life on Mars,where are the dead bodies? No organic molecules could be found - no building blocks ofproteins and nucleic acids, no simple hydrocarbons, nothing of the stuff of life on Earth.This is not necessarily a contradiction, because the Viking microbiology experiments are athousand times more sensitive (per equivalent carbon atom) than the Viking chemistryexperiments, and seem to detect organic matter synthesized in the Martian soil. But thisdoes not leave much margin. Terrestrial soil is loaded with the organic remains ofonce-living organisms; Martian soil has less organic matter than the surface of the Moon. Ifwe held to the life hypothesis, we might suppose that the dead bodies have been destroyedby the chemically reactive, oxidizing surface of Mars - like a germ in a bottle of hydrogenperoxide; or that there is life, but of a kind in which organic chemistry plays a less centralrole than it does in life on Earth.","486":"But this last alternative seems to me to be special pleading: I am, reluctantly, aself-confessed carbon chauvinist. Carbon is abundant in the Cosmos. It makes marvelously","487":"complex molecules, good for life. I am also a water chauvinist. Water makes an idealsolvent system for organic chemistry to work in and stays liquid over a wide range oftemperatures. But sometimes I wonder. Could my fondness for these materials havesomething to do with the fact that I am made chiefly of them? Are we carbon- andwater-based because those materials were abundant on the Earth at the time of the origin oflife? Could life elsewhere - on Mars, say - be built of different stuff?","488":"I am a collection of water, calcium and organic molecules called Carl Sagan. Youare a collection of almost identical molecules with a different collective label. But is thatall? Is there nothing in here but molecules? Some people find this idea somehowdemeaning to human dignity. For myself, I find it elevating that our universe permits theevolution of molecular machines as intricate and subtle as we.","489":"But the essence of life is not so much the atoms and simple molecules that make usup as the way in which they are put together. Every now and then we read that thechemicals which constitute the human body cost ninety-seven cents or ten dollars or somesuch figure; it is a little depressing to find our bodies valued so little. However, theseestimates are for human beings reduced to our simplest possible components. We are mademostly of water, which costs almost nothing; the carbon is costed in the form of coal; thecalcium in our bones as chalk; the nitrogen in our proteins as air (cheap also); the iron inour blood as rusty nails. If we did not know better, we might be tempted to take all theatoms that make us up, mix them together in a big container and stir. We can do this asmuch as we want. But in the end all we have is a tedious mixture of atoms. How could wehave expected anything else?","490":"Harold Morowitz has calculated what it would cost to put together the correctmolecular constituents that make up a human being by buying the molecules from chemicalsupply houses. The answer turns out to be about ten million dollars, which should make usall feel a little better. But even then we could not mix those chemicals together and have ahuman being emerge from the jar. That is far beyond our capability and will probably be sofor a very long period of time. Fortunately, there are other less expensive but still highlyreliable methods of making human beings.","491":"I think the lifeforms on many worlds will consist, by and large, of the same atomswe have here, perhaps even many of the same basic molecules, such as proteins and nucleicacids - but put together in unfamiliar ways. Perhaps organisms that float in dense planetaryatmospheres will be very much like us in their atomic composition, except they might nothave bones and therefore not need much calcium. Perhaps elsewhere some solvent otherthan water is used. Hydrofluoric acid might serve rather well, although there is not a greatdeal of fluorine in the Cosmos; hydrofluoric acid would do a great deal of damage to thekind of molecules that make us up, but other organic molecules, paraffin waxes, forexample, are perfectly stable in its presence. Liquid ammonia would make an even bettersolvent system, because ammonia is very abundant in the Cosmos. But it is liquid only onworlds much colder than the Earth or Mars. Ammonia is ordinarily a gas on Earth, as wateris on Venus. Or perhaps there are living things that do not have a solvent system at all -solid-state life, where there are electrical signals propagating rather than molecules floatingabout.","492":"But these ideas do not rescue the notion that the Viking lander experiments indicate","493":"life on Mars. On that rather Earth-like world, with abundant carbon and water, life, if itexists, should be based on organic chemistry. The organic chemistry results, like theimaging and microbiology results, are all consistent with no life in the fine particles ofChryse and Utopia in the late 1970\u2019s. Perhaps some millimeters beneath the rocks (as in theAntarctic dry valleys), or elsewhere on the planet, or in some earlier, more clement time.","494":"But not where and when we looked.","495":"The Viking exploration of Mars is a mission of major historical importance, the firstserious search for what other kinds of life may be, the first survival of a functioningspacecraft for more than an hour or so on any other planet (Viking 1 has survived for years),the source of a rich harvest of data on the geology, seismology, mineralogy, meteorologyand half a dozen other sciences of another world. How should we follow up on thesespectacular advances? Some scientists want to send an automatic device that would land,acquire soil samples, and return them to Earth, where they could be examined in greatdetail in the large sophisticated laboratories of Earth rather than in the limitedmicrominiaturized laboratories that we are able to send to Mars. In this way most of theambiguities of the Viking microbiology experiments could be resolved. The chemistry andmineralogy of the soil could be determined; rocks could be broken open to search forsubsurface life; hundreds of tests for organic chemistry and life could be performed,including direct microscopic examination, under a wide range of conditions. We could evenuse Vishniac\u2019s scoring techniques. Although it would be fairly expensive, such a mission isprobably within our technological capability.","496":"However, it carries with it a novel danger: back-contamination. If we wish on Earthto examine samples of Martian soil for microbes, we must, of course, not sterilize thesamples beforehand. The point of the expedition is to bring them back alive. But what then?Might Martian microorganisms returned to Earth pose a public health hazard? The Martiansof H. G. Wells and Orson Welles, preoccupied with the suppression of Bournemouth andJersey City, never noticed until too late that their immunological defenses were unavailingagainst the microbes of Earth. Is the converse possible? This is a serious and difficult issue.There may be no micromartians. If they exist, perhaps we can eat a kilogram of them withno ill effects. But we are not sure, and the stakes are high. If we wish to return unsterilizedMartian samples to Earth, we must have a containment procedure that is stupefyinglyreliable. There are nations that develop and stockpile bacteriological weapons. They seemto have an occasional accident, but they have not yet, so far as I know, produced globalpandemics. Perhaps Martian samples can be safely returned to Earth. But I would want tobe very sure before considering a returned- sample mission.","497":"There is another way to investigate Mars and the full range of delights anddiscoveries this heterogeneous planet holds for us. My most persistent emotion in workingwith the Viking lander pictures was frustration at our immobility. I found myselfunconsciously urging the spacecraft at least to stand on its tiptoes, as if this laboratory,designed for immobility, were perversely refusing to manage even a little hop. How welonged to poke that dune with the sample arm, look for life beneath that rock, see if thatdistant ridge was a crater rampart. And not so very far to the southeast, I knew, were thefour sinuous channels of Chryse. For all the tantalizing and provocative character of theViking results, I know a hundred places on Mars which are far more interesting than our","498":"landing sites. The ideal tool is a roving vehicle carrying on advanced experiments,particularly in imaging, chemistry and biology. Prototypes of such rovers are underdevelopment by NASA. They know on their own how to go over rocks, how not to falldown ravines, how to get out of tight spots. It is within our capability to land a rover onMars that could scan its surroundings, see the most interesting place in its field of view and,by the same time tomorrow, be there. Every day a new place, a complex, winding traverseover the varied topography of this appealing planet.","499":"Such a mission would reap enormous scientific benefits, even if there is no life onMars. We could wander down the ancient river valleys, up the slopes of one of the greatvolcanic mountains, along the strange stepped terrain of the icy polar terraces, or muster aclose approach to the beckoning pyramids of Mars.* Public interest in such a missionwould be sizable. Every day a new set of vistas would arrive on our home televisionscreens. We could trace the route, ponder the findings, suggest new destinations. Thejourney would be long, the rover obedient to radio commands from Earth. There would beplenty of time for good new ideas to be incorporated into the mission plan.

They seem eroded and ancient, and are, perhaps, only smallmountains, sandblasted for ages. But they warrant, I think, a careful look.","501":"The surface area of Mars is exactly as large as the land area of the Earth. Athorough reconnaissance will clearly occupy us for centuries. But there will be a time whenMars is all explored; a time after robot aircraft have mapped it from aloft, a time afterrovers have combed the surface, a time after samples have been returned safely to Earth, atime after human beings have walked the sands of Mars. What then? What shall we do withMars?","502":"There are so many examples of human misuse of the Earth that even phrasing thisquestion chills me. If there is life on Mars, I believe we should do nothing with Mars. Marsthen belongs to the Martians, even if the Martians are only microbes. The existence of anindependent biology on a nearby planet is a treasure beyond assessing, and the preservationof that life must, I think, supersede any other possible use of Mars. However, suppose Marsis lifeless. It is not a plausible source of raw materials: the freightage from Mars to Earthwould be too expensive for many centuries to come. But might we be able to live on Mars?Could we in some sense make Mars habitable?","503":"A lovely world, surely, but there is - from our parochial point of view - much wrongwith Mars, chiefly the low oxygen abundance, the absence of liquid water, and the highultraviolet flux. (The low temperatures do not pose an insuperable obstacle, as theyear-round scientific stations in Antarctica demonstrate.) All of these problems could besolved if we could make more air. With higher atmospheric pressures, liquid water wouldbe possible. With more oxygen we might breathe the atmosphere, and ozone would form toshield the surface from solar ultraviolet radiation. The sinuous channels, stacked polarplates and other evidence suggest that Mars once had such a denser atmosphere. Thosegases are unlikely to have escaped from Mars. They are, therefore, on the planet","504":"somewhere. Some are chemically combined with the surface rocks. Some are in subsurfaceice. But most may be in the present polar ice caps.","505":"To vaporize the caps, we must heat them; perhaps we could dust them with a darkpowder, heating them by absorbing more sunlight, the opposite of what we do to the Earthwhen we destroy forests and grasslands. But the surface area of the caps is very large. Thenecessary dust would require 1,200 Saturn 5 rocket boosters to be transported from Earth toMars; even then, the winds might blow the dust off the polar caps. A better way would beto devise some dark material able to make copies of itself, a little dusky machine which wedeliver to Mars and which then goes about reproducing itself from indigenous materials allover the polar caps. There is a category of such machines. We call them plants. Some arevery hardy and resilient. We know that at least some terrestrial microbes can survive on.Mars. What is necessary is a program of artificial selection and genetic engineering of darkplants - perhaps lichens - that could survive the much more severe Martian environment. Ifsuch plants could be bred, we might imagine them being seeded on the vast expanse of theMartian polar ice caps, taking root, spreading, blackening the ice caps, absorbing sunlight,heating the ice, and releasing the ancient Martian atmosphere from its long captivity. Wemight even imagine a kind of Martian Johnny Appleseed, robot or human, roaming thefrozen polar wastes in an endeavor that benefits only the generations of humans to come.","506":"The general concept is called terraforming: the changing of an alien landscape intoone more suitable for human beings. In thousands of years humans have managed toperturb the global temperature of the Earth by only about one degree through greenhouseand albedo changes, although at the present rate of burning fossil fuels and destroyingforests and grasslands we can now change the global temperature by another degree in onlya century or two. These and other considerations suggest that a time scale for a significantterraforming of Mars is probably hundreds to thousands of years. In a future time of greatlyadvanced technology we might wish not only to increase the total atmospheric pressure andmake liquid water possible but also to carry liquid water from the melting polar caps to thewarmer equatorial regions. There is, of course, a way to do it. We would build canals.","507":"The melting surface and subsurface ice would be transported by a great canalnetwork. But this is precisely what Percival Lowell, not a hundred years ago, mistakenlyproposed was in fact happening on Mars. Lowell and Wallace both understood that thecomparative inhospitability of Mars was due to the scarcity of water. If only a network ofcanals existed, the lack would be remedied, the habitability of Mars would becomeplausible. Lowell\u2019s observations were made under extremely difficult seeing conditions.Others, like Schiaparelli, had already observed something like the canals; they were calledcanali before Lowell began his lifelong love affair with Mars. Human beings have ademonstrated talent for self-deception when their emotions are stirred, and there are fewnotions more stirring than the idea of a neighboring planet inhabited by intelligent beings.","508":"The power of Lowell\u2019s idea may, just possibly, make it a kind of premonition. Hiscanal network was built by Martians. Even this may be an accurate prophecy: If the planetever is terraformed, it will be done by human beings whose permanent residence andplanetary affiliation is Mars. The Martians will be us.","509":"Travelers\u2019 Tales","510":"Do there exist many worlds, or is there but a single world?

Ithad been almost two years sailing through interplanetary space. The ship is made ofmillions of separate parts assembled redundantly, so that if some component fails, otherswill take over its responsibilities. The spacecraft weighs 0.9 tons and would fill a largeliving room. Its mission takes it so far from the Sun that it cannot be powered by solarenergy, as other spacecraft are. Instead, Voyager relies on a small nuclear power plant,drawing hundreds of watts from the radioactive decay of a pellet of plutonium. Its threeintegrated computers and most of its housekeeping functions - for example, itstemperature-control system - are localized in its middle. It receives commands from Earth","518":"and radios its findings back to Earth through a large antenna, 3.7 meters in diameter.

The spacecraft must pass through the outer edge of this radiation belt toexamine Jupiter and its moons close up, and to continue its mission to Saturn and beyond.But the charged particles can damage the delicate instruments and fry the electronics.Jupiter is also surrounded by a ring of solid debris, discovered four months earlier byVoyager 1, which Voyager 2 had to traverse. A collision with a small boulder could havesent the spacecraft tumbling wildly out of control, its antenna unable to lock on the Earth,its data lost forever. Just before Encounter, the mission controllers were restive.

In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries youcould travel from Spain to the Azores in a few days, the same time it takes us now to crossthe channel from the Earth to the Moon. It took then a few months to traverse the AtlanticOcean and reach what was called the New World, the Americas. Today it takes a fewmonths to cross the ocean of the inner solar system and make planet-fall on Mars or Venus,which are truly and literally now worlds awaiting us.

These voyages worked much evil as well as much good. Butthe net result has been to bind the Earth together, to decrease provincialism, to unify thehuman species and to advance powerfully our knowledge of our planet and ourselves.","525":"Emblematic of the epoch of sailing-ship exploration and discovery is therevolutionary Dutch Republic of the seventeenth century. Having recently declared itsindependence from the powerful Spanish Empire, it embraced more fully than any othernation of its time the European Enlightenment. It was a rational, orderly, creative society.But because Spanish ports and vessels were closed to Dutch shipping, the economicsurvival of the tiny republic depended on its ability to construct, man and deploy a greatfleet of commercial sailing vessels.","526":"The Dutch East India Company, a joint governmental and private enterprise, sentships to the far corners of the world to acquire rare commodities and resell them at a profitin Europe. Such voyages were the life blood of the Republic. Navigational charts and mapswere classified as state secrets. Ships often embarked with sealed orders. Suddenly theDutch were present all over the planet. The Barents Sea in the Arctic Ocean and Tasmaniain Australia are named after Dutch sea captains. These expeditions were not merelycommercial exploitations, although there was plenty of that. There were powerful elementsof scientific adventure and the zest for discovery of new lands, new plants and animals,new people; the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake.","527":"The Amsterdam Town Hall reflects the confident and secular self-image ofseventeenth-century Holland. It took shiploads of marble to build. Constantijn Huygens, apoet and diplomat of the time, remarked that the Town Hall dispelled \u2018the Gothic squintand squalor.\u2019 In the Town Hall to this day, there is a statue of Atlas supporting the heavens,festooned with constellations. Beneath is Justice, brandishing a golden sword and scales,standing between Death and Punishment, and treading underfoot Avarice and Envy, thegods of the merchants. The Dutch, whose economy was based on private profit,nevertheless understood that the unrestrained pursuit of profit posed a threat to the nation\u2019ssoul.","528":"A less allegorical symbol may be found under Atlas and Justice, on the floor of theTown Hall. It is a great inlaid map, dating from the late seventeenth or early eighteenthcenturies, reaching from West Africa to the Pacific Ocean. The whole world was Holland\u2019sarena. And on this map, with disarming modesty the Dutch omitted themselves, using onlythe old Latin name Belgium for their part of Europe.","529":"In a typical year many ships set sail halfway around the world. Down the west coastof Africa, through what they called the Ethiopian Sea, around the south coast of Africa,within the Straits of Madagascar, and on past the southern tip of India they sailed, to onemajor focus of their interests, the Spice Islands, present-day Indonesia. Some expeditionsjourneyed from there to a land named New Holland, and today called Australia. A fewventured through the Straits of Malacca, past the Philippines, to China. We know from amid-seventeenth-century account of an \u2018Embassy from the East India Company of theUnited Provinces of the Netherlands, to the Grand Tartar, Cham, Emperor of China.\u2019 TheDutch burgers, ambassadors and sea captains stood wide-eyed in amazement, face to face","530":"with another civilization in the Imperial City of Peking.*","531":"* We even know what gifts they brought the Court. The Empress was presented with \u2018six little chestsof divers pictures.\u2019 And the Emperor received \u2018two fardels of cinnamon.\u2019","532":"Never before or since has Holland been the world power it was then. A smallcountry, forced to live by its wits, its foreign policy contained a strong pacifist element.Because of its tolerance for unorthodox opinions, it was a haven for intellectuals who wererefugees from censorship and through control elsewhere in Europe - much as the UnitedStates benefited enormously in the 1930\u2019s by the exodus of intellectuals fromNazi-dominated Europe. So seventeenth-century Holland was the home of the great Jewishphilosopher Spinoza, whom Einstein admired; of Descartes, a pivotal figure in the historyof mathematics and philosophy; and of John Locke, a political scientist who influenced agroup of philosophically inclined revolutionaries named Paine, Hamilton, Adams, Franklinand Jefferson. Never before or since has Holland been graced by such a galaxy of artistsand scientists, philosophers and mathematicians. This was the time of the master paintersRembrandt and Vermeer and Frans Hals; of Leeuwenhoek, the inventor of the microscope;of Grotius, the founder of international law; of Willebrord Snellius, who discovered the lawof the refraction of light.","533":"In the Dutch tradition of encouraging freedom of thought, the University of Leidenoffered a professorship to an Italian scientist named Galileo, who had been forced by theCatholic Church under threat of torture to recant his heretical view that the Earth movedabout the Sun and not vice versa.* Galileo had close ties with Holland, and his firstastronomical telescope was an improvement of a spyglass of Dutch design. With it hediscovered sunspots, the phases of Venus, the craters of the Moon, and the four largemoons of Jupiter now called, after him, the Galilean satellites. Galileo\u2019s own description ofhis ecclesiastical travails is contained in a letter he wrote in the year 1615 to the GrandDuchess Christina:","534":"Some years ago as Your Serene Highness well knows, I discovered in the heavensmany things that had not been seen before our own age. The novelty of these things,as well as some consequences which followed from them in contradiction to thephysical notions commonly held among academic philosophers, stirred up againstme no small number of professors [many of them ecclesiastics] - as if I had placedthese things in the sky with my own hands in order to upset Nature and overturn thesciences. They seemed to forget that the increase of known truths stimulates theinvestigation, establishment, and growth of the arts.**","535":"* In 1979 Pope John Paul II cautiously proposed reversing the condemnation of Galileo done 346years earlier by the 'Holy Inquisition.\u2019","536":"** The courage of Galileo (and Kepler) in promoting the heliocentric hypothesis was not evident inthe actions of others, even those residing in less fanatically doctrinal parts of Europe. For example, in a letterdated April 1634, Rene Descartes, then living in Holland, wrote:","537":"Doubtless you know that Galileo was recently censured by the Inquisitors of the Faith, and that hisviews about the movement of the Earth were condemned as heretical. I must tell you that all thethings I explained in my treatise, which included the doctrine of the movement of the Earth, were sointerdependent that it is enough to discover that one of them is false to know that all the arguments Iwas using are unsound. Though I thought they were based on very certain and evident proofs, Iwould not wish, for anything in the world, to maintain them against the authority of the Church ... Idesire to live in peace and to continue the life I have begun under the motto to live well you must liveunseen.","538":"The connection between Holland as an exploratory power and Holland as an intellectualand cultural center was very strong. The improvement of sailing ships encouragedtechnology of all kinds. People enjoyed working with their hands. Inventions were prized.Technological advance required the freest possible pursuit of knowledge, so Hollandbecame the leading publisher and bookseller in Europe, translating works written in otherlanguages and permitting the publication of works proscribed elsewhere. Adventures intoexotic lands and encounters with strange societies shook complacency, challenged thinkersto reconsider the prevailing wisdom and showed that ideas that had been accepted forthousands of years - for example, on geography - were fundamentally in error. In a timewhen kings and emperors ruled much of the world, the Dutch Republic was governed, morethan any other nation, by the people. The openness of the society and its encouragement ofthe life of the mind, its material well-being and its commitment to the exploration andutilization of new worlds generated a joyful confidence in the human enterprise.*","539":"* This exploratory tradition may account for the fact that Holland has, to this day, produced far morethan its per capita share of distinguished astronomers, among them Gerard Peter Kuiper, who in the 1940\u2019sand 1950\u2019s was the world\u2019s only full-time planetary astrophysicist. The subject was then considered by mostprofessional astronomers to be at least slightly disreputable, tainted with Lowellian excesses. I am grateful tohave been Kuiper\u2019 s student.","540":"In Italy, Galileo had announced other worlds, and Giordano Bruno had speculatedon other lifeforms. For this they had been made to suffer brutally. But in Holland, theastronomer Christiaan Huygens, who believed in both, was showered with honors. Hisfather was Constantijn Huygens, a master diplomat of the age, a litterateur, poet, composer,musician, close friend and translator of the English poet John Donne, and the head of anarchetypical great family. Constantijn admired the painter Rubens, and \u2018discovered\u2019 ayoung artist named Rembrandt van Rijn, in several of whose works he subsequentlyappears. After their first meeting, Descartes wrote of him: \u2018I could not believe that a singlemind could occupy itself with so many things, and equip itself so well in all of them.\u2019 TheHuygens home was filled with goods from all over the world. Distinguished thinkers fromother nations were frequent guests. Growing up in this environment, the young ChristiaanHuygens became simultaneously adept in languages, drawing, law, science, engineering,mathematics and music. His interests and allegiances were broad. \u2018The world is mycountry,\u2019 he said, \u2018science my religion.\u2019","541":"Light was a motif of the age: the symbolic enlightenment of freedom of thought andreligion, of geographical discovery; the light that permeated the paintings of the time,","542":"particularly the exquisite work of Vermeer; and light as an object of scientific inquiry, as inSnell\u2019s study of refraction, Leeuwenhoek\u2019s invention of the microscope and Huygens\u2019 ownwave theory of light.* These were all connected activities, and their practitioners mingledfreely. Vermeer\u2019s interiors are characteristically filled with nautical artifacts and wall maps.Microscopes were drawing-room curiosities. Leeuwenhoek was the executor of Vermeer\u2019sestate and a frequent visitor at the Huygens home in Hofwijck.","543":"* Isaac Newton admired Christiaan Huygens and thought him \u2018the most elegant mathematician\u2019 oftheir time, and the truest follower of the mathematical tradition of the ancient Greeks - then, as now, a greatcompliment. Newton believed, in part because shadows had sharp edges, that light behaved as if it were astream of tiny particles. He thought that red light was composed of the largest particles and violet the smallest.Huygens argued that instead light behaved as if it were a wave propagating in a vacuum, as an ocean wavedoes in the sea - which is why we talk about the wavelength and frequency of light. Many properties of light,including diffraction, are naturally explained by the wave theory, and in subsequent years Huygens\u2019 viewcarried the day. But in 1905, Einstein showed that the particle theory of light could explain the photoelectriceffect, the ejection of electrons from a metal upon exposure to a beam of light. Modem quantum mechanicscombines both ideas, and it is customary today to think of light as behaving in some circumstances as a beamof particles and in others as a wave. This wave-particle dualism may not correspond readily to ourcommon-sense notions, but it is in excellent accord with what experiments have shown light really does.","544":"There is something mysterious and stirring in this marriage of opposites, and it is fitting that Newton andHuygens, bachelors both, were the parents of our modem understanding of the nature of light.","545":"Leeuwenhoek\u2019s microscope evolved from the magnifying glasses employed bydrapers to examine the quality of cloth. With it he discovered a universe in a drop of water:the microbes, which he described as \u2018animalcules\u2019 and thought \u2018cute\u2019. Huygens hadcontributed to the design of the first microscopes and himself made many discoveries withthem. Leeuwenhoek and Huygens were among the first people ever to see human spermcells, a prerequisite for understanding human reproduction. To explain howmicroorganisms slowly develop in water previously sterilized by boiling, Huygensproposed that they were small enough to float through the air and reproduced on alightingin water. Thus he established an alternative to spontaneous generation - the notion that lifecould arise, in fermenting grape juice or rotting meat, entirely independent of preexistinglife. It was not until the time of Louis Pasteur, two centuries later, that Huygens\u2019speculation was proved correct. The Viking search for life on Mars can be traced in moreways than one back to Leeuwenhoek and Huygens. They are also the grandfathers of thegerm theory of disease, and therefore of much of modern medicine. But they had nopractical motives in mind. They were merely tinkering in a technological society.","546":"The microscope and telescope, both developed in early seventeenth-century Holland,represent an extension of human vision to the realms of the very small and the very large.Our observations of atoms and galaxies were launched in this time and place. ChristiaanHuygens loved to grind and polish lenses for astronomical telescopes and constructed onefive meters long. His discoveries with the telescope would by themselves have ensured hisplace in the history of human accomplishment. In the footsteps of Eratosthenes, he was thefirst person to measure the size of another planet. He was also the first to speculate thatVenus is completely covered with clouds; the first to draw a surface feature on the planetMars (a vast dark windswept slope called Syrtis Major); and by observing the appearance","547":"and disappearance of such features as the planet rotated, the first to determine that theMartian day was, like ours, roughly twenty-four hours long. He was the first to recognizethat Saturn was surrounded by a system of rings which nowhere touches the planet.* Andhe was the discoverer of Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and, as we now know, the largestmoon in the solar system - a world of extraordinary interest and promise. Most of thesediscoveries he made in his twenties. He also thought astrology was nonsense.","548":"* Galileo discovered the rings, but had no idea what to make of them. Through his earlyastronomical telescope, they seemed to be two projections symmetrically attached to Saturn, resembling, hesaid in some bafflement, ears.","549":"Huygens did much more. A key problem for marine navigation in this age was thedetermination of longitude. Latitude could easily be determined by the stars - the farthersouth you were, the more southern constellations you could see. But longitude requiredprecise timekeeping. An accurate shipboard clock would tell the time in your home port;the rising and setting of the Sun and stars would specify the local shipboard time; and thedifference between the two would yield your longitude. Huygens invented the pendulumclock (its principle had been discovered earlier by Galileo), which was then employed,although not fully successfully, to calculate position in the midst of the great ocean. Hisefforts introduced an unprecedented accuracy in astronomical and other scientificobservations and stimulated further advances in nautical clocks. He invented the spiralbalance spring still used in some watches today; made fundamental contributions tomechanics - e.g., the calculation of centrifugal force - and, from a study of the game of dice,to the theory of probability. He improved the air pump, which was later to revolutionize themining industry, and the \u2018magic lantern,\u2019 the ancestor of the slide projector. He alsoinvented something called the \u2018gunpowder engine,\u2019 which influenced the development ofanother machine, the steam engine.","550":"Huygens was delighted that the Copernican view of the Earth as a planet in motionaround the Sun was widely accepted even by the ordinary people in Holland. Indeed, hesaid, Copernicus was acknowledged by all astronomers except those who \u2018were a bitslow-witted or under the superstitions imposed by merely human authority.\u2019 In the MiddleAges, Christian philosophers were fond of arguing that, since the heavens circle the Earthonce every day, they can hardly be infinite in extent; and therefore an infinite number ofworlds, or even a large number of them (or even one other of them), is impossible. Thediscovery that the Earth is turning rather than the sky moving had important implicationsfor the uniqueness of the Earth and the possibility of life elsewhere. Copernicus held thatnot just the solar system but the entire universe was heliocentric, and Kepler denied that thestars have planetary systems. The first person to make explicit the idea of a large - indeed,an infinite - number of other worlds in orbit about other suns seems to have been GiordanoBruno. But others thought that the plurality of worlds followed immediately from the ideasof Copernicus and Kepler and found themselves aghast. In the early seventeenth century,Robert Merton contended that the heliocentric hypothesis implied a multitude of otherplanetary systems, and that this was an argument of the sort called reductio ad absurdum(Appendix 1), demonstrating the error of the initial assumption. He wrote, in an argument","551":"which may once have seemed withering,","552":"For if the firmament be of such an incomparable bigness, as these Copernical giantswill have it . . . , so vast and full of innumerable stars, as being infinite in extent . . .why may we not suppose . . . those infinite stars visible in the firmament to be somany suns, with particular fixed centers; to have likewise their subordinate planets,as the sun hath his dancing still around him? . . . And so, in consequence, there areinfinite habitable worlds; what hinders? . . . these and suchlike insolent and boldattempts, prodigious paradoxes, inferences must needs follow, if it once be grantedwhich . . . Kepler . . . and others maintain of the Earth\u2019s motion.","553":"But the Earth does move. Merton, if he lived today, would be obliged to deduce \u2018infinite,habitable worlds.\u2019 Huygens did not shrink from this conclusion; he embraced it gladly:Across the sea of space the stars are other suns. By analogy with our solar system, Huygensreasoned that those stars should have their own planetary systems and that many of theseplanets might be inhabited: \u2018Should we allow the planets nothing but vast deserts . . . anddeprive them of all those creatures that more plainly bespeak their divine architect, weshould sink them below the Earth in beauty and dignity, a thing very unreasonable.\u2019*","554":"* A few others had held similar opinions. In his Harmonice Mundi Kepler remarked \u2018it was TychoBrahe\u2019s opinion concerning that bare wilderness of globes that it does not exist fruitlessly but is filled withinhabitants.\u2019","555":"These ideas were set forth in an extraordinary book bearing the triumphant title TheCelestial Worlds Discover\u2019d: Conjectures Concerning the Inhabitants, Plants andProductions of the Worlds in the Planets. Composed shortly before Huygens died in 1690,the work was admired by many, including Czar Peter the Great, who made it the firstproduct of Western science to be published in Russia. The book is in large part about thenature or environments of the planets. Among the figures in the finely rendered first editionis one in which we see, to scale, the Sun and the giant planets Jupiter and Saturn. They are,comparatively, rather small. There is also an etching of Saturn next to the Earth: Our planetis a tiny circle.","556":"By and large Huygens imagined the environments and inhabitants of other planetsto be rather like those of seventeenth-century Earth. He conceived of \u2018planetarians\u2019 whose\u2018whole Bodies, and every part of them, may be quite distinct and different from ours . . . \u2018tisa very ridiculous opinion . . . that it is impossible a rational Soul should dwell in any othershape than ours.\u2019 You could be smart, he was saying, even if you looked peculiar. But hethen went on to argue that they would not look very peculiar - that they must have handsand feet and walk upright, that they would have writing and geometry, and that Jupiter hasits four Galilean satellites to provide a navigational aid for the sailors in the Jovian oceans.Huygens was, of course, a citizen of his time. Who of us is not? He claimed science as hisreligion and then argued that the planets must be inhabited because otherwise God hadmade worlds for nothing. Because he lived before Darwin, his speculations aboutextraterrestrial life are innocent of the evolutionary perspective. But he was able to develop","557":"on observational grounds something akin to the modern cosmic perspective:","558":"What a wonderful and Amazing scheme have we here of the magnificent vastnessof the universe ... So many Suns, so many Earths . . . and every one of themstock\u2019d with so many Herbs, Trees, and Animals, adorn\u2019d with so many Seas andMountains! . . . And how must our Wonder and Admiration be increased when weconsider the prodigious Distance and Multitude of the Stars.","559":"The Voyager spacecraft are the lineal descendants of those sailing-ship voyages ofexploration, and of the scientific and speculative tradition of Christiaan Huygens. TheVoyagers are caravels bound for the stars, and on the way exploring those worlds thatHuygens knew and loved so well.","560":"One of the main commodities returned on those voyages of centuries ago weretravelers\u2019 tales,* stories of alien lands and exotic creatures that evoked our sense of wonderand stimulated future exploration. There had been accounts of mountains that reached thesky; of dragons and sea monsters; of everyday eating utensils made of gold; of a beast withan arm for a nose; of people who thought the doctrinal disputes among Protestants,Catholics, Jews and Muslims to be silly; of a black stone that burned; of headless humanswith mouths in their chests; of sheep that grew on trees. Some of these stories were true;some were lies. Others had a kernel of truth, misunderstood or exaggerated by the explorersor their informants. In the hands of Voltaire, say, or Jonathan Swift, these accountsstimulated a new perspective on European society, forcing a reconsideration of that insularworld.","561":"* Such tales are an ancient human tradition; many of them have had, from the beginning ofexploration, a cosmic motif. For example, the fifteenth-century explorations of Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India,Arabia and Africa by the Ming Dynasty Chinese were described by Fei Hsin, one of the participants, in apicture book prepared for the Emperor, as \u2018The Triumphant Visions of the Starry Raft.\u2019 Unfortunately, thepictures - although not the text - have been lost.","562":"Modern Voyagers also return travelers\u2019 tales, tales of a world shattered like a crystalsphere; a globe where the ground is covered, pole to pole, with what looks like a network ofcobwebs; tiny moons shaped like potatoes; a world with an underground ocean; a land thatsmells of rotten eggs and looks like a pizza pie, with lakes of molten sulfur and volcaniceruptions ejecting smoke directly into space; a planet called Jupiter that dwarfs our own -so large that 1,000 Earths would fit within it.","563":"The Galilean satellites of Jupiter are each almost as big as the planet Mercury. Wecan measure their sizes and masses and so calculate their density, which tells us somethingabout the composition of their interiors. We find that the inner two, lo and Europa, have adensity as high as rock. The outer two, Ganymede and Callisto, have a much lower density,halfway between rock and ice. But the mixture of ice and rocks within these outer moonsmust contain, as do rocks on Earth, traces of radioactive minerals, which heat theirsurroundings. There is no effective way for this heat, accumulated over billions of years, toreach the surface and be lost to space, and the radioactivity inside Ganymede and Callisto","564":"must therefore melt their icy interiors. We anticipate underground oceans of slush andwater in these moons, a hint, before we have ever seen the surfaces of the Galilean satellitesclose up, that they may be very different one from another. When we do look closely,through the eyes of Voyager, this prediction is confirmed. They do not resemble each other.They are different from any worlds we have ever seen before.","565":"The Voyager 2 spacecraft will never return to Earth. But its scientific findings, itsepic discoveries, its travelers\u2019 tales, do return. Take July 9, 1979, for instance. At 8:04Pacific Standard Time on this morning, the first pictures of a new world, called Europaafter an old one, were received on Earth.","566":"How does a picture from the outer solar system get to us? Sunlight shines on Europain its orbit around Jupiter and is reflected back to space, where some of it strikes thephosphors of the Voyager television cameras, generating an image. The image is read bythe Voyager computers, radioed back across the immense intervening distance of half abillion kilometers to a radio telescope, a ground station on the Earth. There is one in Spain,one in the Mojave Desert of Southern California and one in Australia. (On that Julymorning in 1979 it was the one in Australia that was pointed toward Jupiter and Europa.) Itthen passes the information via a communications satellite in Earth orbit to SouthernCalifornia, where it is transmitted by a set of microwave relay towers to a computer at theJet Propulsion Laboratory, where it is processed. The picture is fundamentally like anewspaper wirephoto, made of perhaps a million individual dots, each a different shade ofgray, so fine and close together that at a distance the constituent dots are invisible. We seeonly their cumulative effect. The information from the spacecraft specifies how bright ordark each dot is to be. After processing, the dots are then stored on a magnetic disc,something like a phonograph record. There are some eighteen thousand photographs takenin the Jupiter system by Voyager 1 that are stored on such magnetic discs, and anequivalent number for Voyager 2. Finally, the end product of this remarkable set of linksand relays is a thin piece of glossy paper, in this case showing the wonders of Europa,recorded, processed and examined for the first time in human history on July 9, 1979.","567":"What we saw on such pictures was absolutely astonishing. Voyager 1 obtainedexcellent imagery of the other three Galilean satellites of Jupiter. But not Europa. It was leftfor Voyager 2 to acquire the first close-up pictures of Europa, where we see things that areonly a few kilometers across. At first glance, the place looks like nothing so much as thecanal network that Percival Lowell imagined to adorn Mars, and that, we now know fromspace vehicle exploration, does not exist at all. We see on Europa an amazing, intricatenetwork of intersecting straight and curved lines. Are they ridges - that is, raised? Are theytroughs - that is, depressed? How are they made? Are they part of a global tectonic system,produced perhaps by fracturing of an expanding or contracting planet? Are they connectedwith plate tectonics on the Earth? What light do they shed on the other satellites of theJovian system? At the moment of discovery, the vaunted technology has producedsomething astonishing. But it remains for another device, the human brain, to figure it out.Europa turns out to be as smooth as a billiard ball despite the network of lineations. Theabsence of impact craters may be due to the heating and flow of surface ice upon impact.The lines are grooves or cracks, their origin still being debated long after the mission.","568":"If the Voyager missions were manned, the captain would keep a ship\u2019s log, and the","569":"log, a combination of the events of Voyagers 1 and 2, might read something like this:","570":"Day 1 After much concern about provisions and instruments, which seemed to bemalfunctioning, we successfully lifted off from Cape Canaveral on our long journeyto the planets and the stars.","571":"Day 2 A problem in the deployment of the boom that supports the science scanplatform. If the problem is not solved, we will lose most of our pictures and otherscientific data.","572":"Day 1 3 We have looked back and taken the first photograph ever obtained of theEarth and Moon as worlds together in space. A pretty pair.","573":"Day 150 Engines fired nominally for a mid-course trajectory correction.","574":"Day 170 Routine housekeeping functions. An uneventful few months.","575":"Day 185 Successful calibration images taken of Jupiter.","576":"Day 207 Boom problem solved, but failure of main radio transmitter. We havemoved to back-up transmitter. If it fails, no one on Earth will ever hear from usagain.","577":"Day 215 We cross the orbit of Mars. The planet itself is on the other side of the Sun.","578":"Day 295 We enter the asteroid belt. There are many large, tumbling boulders here,the shoals and reefs of space. Most of them are uncharted. Lookouts posted. Wehope to avoid a collision.","579":"Day 475 We safely emerge from the main asteroid belt, happy to have survived.","580":"Day 570 Jupiter is becoming prominent in the sky. We can now make out finerdetail on it than the largest telescopes on Earth have ever obtained.","581":"Day 615 The colossal weather systems and changing clouds of Jupiter, spinning inspace before us, have us hypnotized. The planet is immense. It is more than twice asmassive as all the other planets put together. There are no mountains, valleys,volcanoes, rivers; no boundaries between land and air; just a vast ocean of dense gasand floating clouds - a world without a surface. Everything we can see on Jupiter isfloating in its sky.","582":"Day 630 The weather on Jupiter continues to be spectacular. This ponderous worldspins on its axis in less than ten hours. Its atmospheric motions are driven by therapid rotation, by sunlight and by the heat bubbling and welling up from its interior.","583":"Day 640 The cloud patterns are distinctive and gorgeous. They remind us a little ofVan Gogh\u2019s Starry Night, or works by William Blake or Edvard Munch. But only alittle. No artist ever painted like this because none of them ever left our planet. Nopainter trapped on Earth ever imagined a world so strange and lovely.","584":"We observe the multicolored belts and bands of Jupiter close up. The whitebands are thought to be high clouds, probably ammonia crystals; thebrownish-colored belts, deeper and hotter places where the atmosphere is sinking.The blue places are apparently deep holes in the overlying clouds through which wesee clear sky.","585":"We do not know the reason for the reddish-brown color of Jupiter. Perhaps itis due to the chemistry of phosphorus or sulfur. Perhaps it is due to complexbrightly colored organic molecules produced when ultraviolet light from the Sunbreaks down the methane, ammonia, and water in the Jovian atmosphere and themolecular fragments recombine. In that case, the colors of Jupiter speak to us ofchemical events that four billion years ago back on Earth led to the origin of life.","586":"Day 647 The Great Red Spot. A great column of gas reaching high above theadjacent clouds, so large that it could hold half a dozen Earths. Perhaps it is redbecause it is carrying up to view the complex molecules produced or concentrated atgreater depth. It may be a great storm system a million years old.","587":"Day 650 Encounter. A day of wonders. We successfully negotiate the treacherousradiation belts of Jupiter with only one instrument, the photopolarimeter, damaged.We accomplish the ring plane crossing and suffer no collisions with the particlesand boulders of the newly discovered rings of Jupiter. And wonderful images ofAmalthea, a tiny, red, oblong world that lives in the heart of the radiation belt; ofmulticolored Io; of the linear markings on Europa; the cobwebby features ofGanymede; the great multi-ringed basin on Callisto. We round Callisto and pass theorbit of Jupiter 13, the outermost of the planet\u2019s known moons. We are outwardbound.","588":"Day 662 Our particle and field detectors indicate that we have left the Jovianradiation belts. The planet\u2019s gravity has boosted our speed. We are free of Jupiter atlast and sail again the sea of space.","589":"Day 874 A loss of the ship\u2019s lock on the star Canopus - in the lore of constellationsthe rudder of a sailing vessel. It is our rudder too, essential for the ship\u2019s orientationin the dark of space, to find our way through this unexplored part of the cosmicocean. Canopus lock reacquired. The optical sensors seem to have mistaken Alphaand Beta Centauri for Canopus. Next port of call, two years hence: the Saturnsystem.","590":"Of all the travelers\u2019 tales returned by Voyager, my favorites concern the discoveriesmade on the innermost Galilean satellite, Io.* Before Voyager, we were aware ofsomething strange about Io. We could resolve few features on its surface, but we knew itwas red - extremely red, redder than Mars, perhaps the reddest object in the solar system.Over a period of years something seemed to be changing on it, in infrared light and perhapsin its radar reflection properties. We also know that partially surrounding Jupiter in theorbital position of Io was a great doughnut-shaped tube of atoms, sulfur and sodium andpotassium, material somehow lost from Io.","591":"* Frequently pronounced 'eye- oh\u2019 by Americans, because this is the preferred enunciation in theOxford English Dictionary. But the British have no special wisdom here. The word is of EasternMediterranean origin and is pronounced throughout the rest of Europe, correctly, as \u2018ee-oh.\u2019","592":"When Voyager approached this giant moon we found a strange multicolored surfaceunlike any other in the solar system. Io is near the asteroid belt. It must have beenthoroughly pummeled throughout its history by falling boulders. Impact craters must havebeen made. Yet there were none to be seen. Accordingly, there had to be some process onIo that was extremely efficient in rubbing craters out or filling them in. The process couldnot be atmospheric, since Io\u2019s atmosphere has mostly escaped to space because of its lowgravity. It could not be running water; Io\u2019s surface is far too cold. There were a few placesthat resembled the summits of volcanoes. But it was hard to be sure.","593":"Linda Morabito, a member of the Voyager Navigation Team responsible forkeeping Voyager precisely on its trajectory, was routinely ordering a computer to enhancean image of the edge of Io, to bring out the stars behind it. To her astonishment, she saw abright plume standing off in the darkness from the satellite\u2019s surface and soon determinedthat the plume was in exactly the position of one of the suspected volcanoes. Voyager haddiscovered the first active volcano beyond the Earth. We know now of nine large volcanoes,spewing out gas and debris, and hundreds - perhaps thousands - of extinct volcanoes on Io.The debris, rolling and flowing down the sides of the volcanic mountains, arching in greatjets over the polychrome landscape, is more than enough to cover the impact craters. Weare looking at a fresh planetary landscape, a surface newly hatched. How Galileo andHuygens would have marveled.","594":"The volcanoes of Io were predicted, before they were discovered, by Stanton Pealeand his co-workers, who calculated the tides that would be raised in the solid interior of Ioby the combined pulls of the nearby moon Europa and the giant planet Jupiter. They foundthat the rocks inside Io should have been melted, not by radioactivity but by tides; thatmuch of the interior of Io should be liquid. It now seems likely that the volcanoes of Io aretapping an underground ocean of liquid sulfur, melted and concentrated near the surface.When solid sulfur is heated a little past the normal boiling point of water, to about 1 15\u00b0C, itmelts and changes color. The higher the temperature, the deeper the color. If the moltensulfur is quickly cooled, it retains its color. The pattern of colors that we see on Ioresembles closely what we would expect if rivers and torrents and sheets of molten sulfurwere pouring out of the mouths of the volcanoes: black sulfur, the hottest, near the top ofthe volcano; red and orange, including the rivers, nearby; and great plains covered by","595":"yellow sulfur at a greater remove. The surface of Io is changing on a time scale of months.Maps will have to be issued regularly, like weather reports on Earth. Those future explorerson Io will have to keep their wits about them.","596":"The very thin and tenuous atmosphere of Io was found by Voyager to be composedmainly of sulfur dioxide. But this thin atmosphere can serve a useful purpose, because itmay be just thick enough to protect the surface from the intense charged particles in theJupiter radiation belt in which Io is embedded. At night the temperature drops so low thatthe sulfur dioxide should condense out as a kind of white frost; the charged particles wouldthen immolate the surface, and it would probably be wise to spend the nights just slightlyunderground.","597":"The great volcanic plumes of Io reach so high that they are close to injecting theiratoms directly into the space around Jupiter. The volcanoes are the probable source of thegreat doughnut-shaped ring of atoms that surrounds Jupiter in the position of Io\u2019s orbit.These atoms, gradually spiraling in toward Jupiter, should coat the inner moon Amaltheaand may be responsible for its reddish coloration. It is even possible that the materialoutgassed from Io contributes, after many collisions and condensations, to the ring systemof Jupiter.","598":"A substantial human presence on Jupiter itself is much more difficult to imagine -although I suppose great balloon cities permanently floating in its atmosphere are atechnological possibility for the remote future. As seen from the near sides of Io or Europa,that immense and variable world fills much of the sky, hanging aloft, never to rise or set,because almost every satellite in the solar system keeps a constant face to its planet, as theMoon does to the Earth. Jupiter will be a source of continuing provocation and excitementfor the future human explorers of the Jovian moons.","599":"As the solar system condensed out of interstellar gas and dust, Jupiter acquired mostof the matter that was not ejected into interstellar space and did not fall inward to form theSun. Had Jupiter been several dozen times more massive, the matter in its interior wouldhave undergone thermonuclear reactions, and Jupiter would have begun to shine by its ownlight. The largest planet is a star that failed. Even so, its interior temperatures aresufficiently high that it gives off about twice as much energy as it receives from the Sun. Inthe infrared part of the spectrum, it might even be correct to consider Jupiter a star. Had itbecome a star in visible light, we would today inhabit a binary or double-star system, withtwo suns in our sky, and the nights would come more rarely - a commonplace, I believe, incountless solar systems throughout the Milky Way Galaxy. We would doubtless think thecircumstances natural and lovely.","600":"Deep below the clouds of Jupiter the weight of the overlying layers of atmosphereproduces pressures much higher than any found on Earth, pressures so great that electronsare squeezed off hydrogen atoms, producing a remarkable substance, liquid metallichydrogen - a physical state that has never been observed in terrestrial laboratories, becausethe requisite pressures have never been achieved on Earth. (There is some hope thatmetallic hydrogen is a superconductor at moderate temperatures. If it could bemanufactured on Earth, it would work a revolution in electronics.) In the interior of Jupiter,where the pressures are about three million times the atmospheric pressure at the surface ofthe Earth, there is almost nothing but a great dark sloshing ocean of metallic hydrogen. But","601":"at the very core of Jupiter there may be a lump of rock and iron, an Earth-like world in apressure vise, hidden forever at the center of the largest planet.","602":"The electrical currents in the liquid metal interior of Jupiter may be the source of theplanet\u2019s enormous magnetic field, the largest in the solar system, and of its associated beltof trapped electrons and protons. These charged particles are ejected from the Sun in thesolar wind and captured and accelerated by Jupiter\u2019s magnetic field. Vast numbers of themare trapped far above the clouds and are condemned to bounce from pole to pole until bychance they encounter some high-altitude atmospheric molecule and are removed from theradiation belt. Io moves in an orbit so close to Jupiter that it plows through the midst of thisintense radiation, creating cascades of charged particles, which in turn generate violentbursts of radio energy. (They may also influence eruptive processes on the surface of Io.) Itis possible to predict radio bursts from Jupiter with better reliability than weather forecastson Earth, by computing the position of Io.","603":"That Jupiter is a source of radio emission was discovered accidentally in the 1950\u2019s,the early days of radio astronomy. Two young Americans, Bernard Burke and KennethFranklin, were examining the sky with a newly constructed and for that time very sensitiveradio telescope. They were searching the cosmic radio background - that is, radio sourcesfar beyond our solar system. To their surprise, they found an intense and previouslyunreported source that seemed to correspond to no prominent star, nebula or galaxy. Whatis more, it gradually moved, with respect to the distant stars, much faster than any remoteobject could.* After finding no likely explanation of all this in their charts of the distantCosmos, they one day stepped outside the observatory and looked up at the sky with thenaked eye to see if anything interesting happened to be there. Bemusedly they noted anexceptionally bright object in the right place, which they soon identified as the planetJupiter. This accidental discovery is, incidentally, entirely typical of the history of science.","604":"* Because the speed of light is finite (see Chapter 8).","605":"Every evening before Voyager l\u2019s encounter with Jupiter, I could see that giantplanet twinkling in the sky, a sight our ancestors have enjoyed and wondered at for amillion years. And on the evening of Encounter, on my way to study the Voyager dataarriving at JPL, I thought that Jupiter would never be the same, never again just a point oflight in the night sky, but would forever after be a place to be explored and known. Jupiterand its moons are a kind of miniature solar system of diverse and exquisite worlds withmuch to teach us.","606":"In composition and in many other respects Saturn is similar to Jupiter, althoughsmaller. Rotating once every ten hours, it exhibits colorful equatorial banding, which is,however, not so prominent as Jupiter\u2019s. It has a weaker magnetic field and radiation beltthan Jupiter and a more spectacular set of circumplanetary rings. And it also is surroundedby a dozen or more satellites.","607":"The most interesting of the moons of Saturn seems to be Titan, the largest moon inthe solar system and the only one with a substantial atmosphere. Prior to the encounter ofVoyager 1 with Titan in November 1980, our information about Titan was scanty andtantalizing. The only gas known unambiguously to be present was methane, CH 4 ,","608":"discovered by G. P. Kuiper. Ultraviolet light from the sun converts methane to morecomplex hydrocarbon molecules and hydrogen gas. The hydrocarbons should remain onTitan, covering the surface with a brownish tarry organic sludge, something like thatproduced in experiments on the origin of life on Earth. The lightweight hydrogen gasshould, because of Titan\u2019s low gravity, rapidly escape to space by a violent process knownas \u2018blowoff,\u2019 which should carry the methane and other atmospheric constituents with it.But Titan has an atmospheric pressure at least as great as that of the planet Mars. Blowoffdoes not seem to be happening. Perhaps there is some major and as yet undiscoveredatmospheric constituent - nitrogen, for example - which keeps the average molecularweight of the atmosphere high and prevents blowoff. Or perhaps blowoff is happening, butthe gases lost to space are being replenished by others released from the satellite\u2019s interior.The bulk density of Titan is so low that there must be a vast supply of water and other ices,probably including methane, which are at unknown rates being released to the surface byinternal heating.","609":"When we examine Titan through the telescope we see a barely perceptible reddishdisc. Some observers have reported variable white clouds above that disc - most likely,clouds of methane crystals. But what is responsible for the reddish coloration? Moststudents of Titan agree that complex organic molecules are the most likely explanation. Thesurface temperature and atmospheric thickness are still under debate. There have been somehints of an enhanced surface temperature due to an atmospheric greenhouse effect. Withabundant organic molecules on its surface and in its atmosphere, Titan is a remarkable andunique denizen of the solar system. The history of our past voyages of discovery suggeststhat Voyager and other spacecraft reconnaissance missions will revolutionize ourknowledge of this place.","610":"Through a break in the clouds of Titan, you might glimpse Saturn and its rings, theirpale yellow color diffused by the intervening atmosphere. Because the Saturn system is tentimes farther from the Sun than is the Earth, the sunshine on Titan is only 1 percent asintense as we are accustomed to, and the temperatures should be far below the freezingpoint of water even with a sizable atmospheric greenhouse effect. But with abundantorganic matter, sunlight and perhaps volcanic hot spots, the possibility of life on Titan*cannot be readily dismissed. In that very different environment, it would, of course, have tobe very different from life on Earth. There is no strong evidence either for or against life onTitan. It is merely possible. We are unlikely to determine the answer to this questionwithout landing instrumented space vehicles on the Titanian surface.","611":"* The view of Huygens, who discovered Titan in 1655, was: \u2018Now can any one look upon, andcompare these Systems [of Jupiter and Saturn] together, without being amazed at the vast Magnitude andnoble Attendants of these two Planets, in respect of this little pitiful Earth of ours? Or can they forcethemselves to think, that the wise Creator has disposed of all his Animals and Plants here, has furnished andadorn\u2019d this Spot only, and has left all those Worlds bare and destitute of Inhabitants, who might adore andworship Him; or that all those prodigious Bodies were made only to twinkle to, and be studied by some fewperhaps of us poor Fellows?\u2019 Since Saturn moves around the Sun once every thirty years, the length of theseasons on Saturn and its moons is much longer than on Earth. Of the presumed inhabitants of the moons ofSaturn, Huygens therefore wrote: \u2018It is impossible but that their way of living must be very different fromours, having such tedious Winters.\u2019","612":"To examine the individual particles composing the rings of Saturn, we mustapproach them closely, for the particles are small - snowballs and ice chips and tinytumbling bonsai glaciers, a meter or so across. We know they are composed of water ice,because the spectral properties of sunlight reflected off the rings match those of ice in thelaboratory measurements. To approach the particles in a space vehicle, we must slow down,so that we move along with them as they circle Saturn at some 45,000 miles per hour; thatis, we must be in orbit around Saturn ourselves, moving at the same speed as the particles.Only then will we be able to see them individually and not as smears or streaks.","613":"Why is there not a single large satellite instead of a ring system around Saturn? Thecloser a ring particle is to Saturn, the faster its orbital speed (the faster it is \u2018falling\u2019 aroundthe planet - Kepler\u2019s third law); the inner particles are streaming past the outer ones (the\u2018passing lane\u2019 as we see it is always to the left). Although the whole assemblage is tearingaround the planet itself at some 20 kilometers per second, the relative speed of two adjacentparticles is very low, only some few centimeters per minute. Because of this relativemotion, the particles can never stick together by their mutual gravity. As soon as they try,their slightly different orbital speeds pull them apart. If the rings were not so close to Saturn,this effect would not be so strong, and the particles could accrete, making small snowballsand eventually growing into satellites. So it is probably no coincidence that outside therings of Saturn there is a system of satellites varying in size from a few hundred kilometersacross to Titan, a giant moon nearly as large as the planet Mars. The matter in all thesatellites and the planets themselves may have been originally distributed in the form ofrings, which condensed and accumulated to form the present moons and planets.","614":"For Saturn as for Jupiter, the magnetic field captures and accelerates the chargedparticles of the solar wind. When a charged particle bounces from one magnetic pole to theother, it must cross the equatorial plane of Saturn. If there is a ring particle in the way, theproton or electron is absorbed by this small snowball. As a result, for both planets, the ringsclear out the radiation belts, which exist only interior and exterior to the particle rings. Aclose moon of Jupiter or Saturn will likewise gobble up radiation belt particles, and in factone of the new moons of Saturn was discovered in just this way: Pioneer 1 1 found anunexpected gap in the radiation belts, caused by the sweeping up of charged particles by apreviously unknown moon.","615":"The solar wind trickles into the outer solar system far beyond the orbit of Saturn.When Voyager reaches Uranus and the orbits of Neptune and Pluto, if the instruments arestill functioning, they will almost certainly sense its presence, the wind between the worlds,the top of the Sun\u2019s atmosphere blown outward toward the realm of the stars. Some two orthree times farther from the Sun than Pluto is, the pressure of the interstellar protons andelectrons becomes greater than the minuscule pressure there exerted by the solar wind. Thatplace, called the heliopause, is one definition of the outer boundary of the Empire of theSun. But the Voyager spacecraft will plunge on, penetrating the heliopause sometime in themiddle of the twenty-first century, skimming through the ocean of space, never to enteranother solar system, destined to wander through eternity far from the stellar islands and tocomplete its first circumnavigation of the massive center of the Milky Way a few hundred","616":"million years from now.

When, therefore, he ascribes to his gods the productionof some phenomenon . . . does he, in fact, do any thing more than substitute for thedarkness of his own mind, a sound to which he has been accustomed to listen withreverential awe?","625":"- Paul Heinrich Dietrich, Baron von Holbach, Systeme de la Nature, London, 1770","626":"When I was little, I lived in the Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn in the City of New York. Iknew my immediate neighborhood intimately, every apartment building, pigeon coop,backyard, front stoop, empty lot, elm tree, ornamental railing, coal chute and wall forplaying Chinese handball, among which the brick exterior of a theater called the Loew\u2019sStillwell was of superior quality. I knew where many people lived: Bruno and Dino, Ronaldand Harvey, Sandy, Bernie, Danny, Jackie and Myra. But more than a few blocks away,north of the raucous automobile traffic and elevated railway on 86th Street, was a strangeunknown territory, off-limits to my wanderings. It could have been Mars for all I knew.","627":"Even with an early bedtime, in winter you could sometimes see the stars. I wouldlook at them, twinkling and remote, and wonder what they were. I would ask older children","628":"and adults, who would only reply, \u2018They\u2019re lights in the sky, kid.\u2019 I could see they werelights in the sky. But what were they? Just small hovering lamps? Whatever for? I felt akind of sorrow for them: a commonplace whose strangeness remained somehow hiddenfrom my incurious fellows. There had to be some deeper answer.","629":"As soon as I was old enough, my parents gave me my first library card. I think thelibrary was on 85th Street, an alien land. Immediately, I asked the librarian for somethingon stars. She returned with a picture book displaying portraits of men and women withnames like Clark Gable and Jean Harlow. I complained, and for some reason then obscureto me, she smiled and found another book - the right kind of book. I opened it breathlesslyand read until I found it. The book said something astonishing, a very big thought. It saidthat the stars were suns, only very far away. The Sun was a star, but close up.","630":"Imagine that you took the Sun and moved it so far away that it was just a tinytwinkling point of light. How far away would you have to move it? I was innocent of thenotion of angular size. I was ignorant of the inverse square law for light propagation. I hadnot a ghost of a chance of calculating the distance to the stars. But I could tell that if thestars were suns, they had to be very far away - farther away than 85th Street, farther awaythan Manhattan, farther away, probably, than New Jersey. The Cosmos was much biggerthan I had guessed.","631":"Later I read another astonishing fact. The Earth, which includes Brooklyn, is aplanet, and it goes around the Sun. There are other planets. They also go around the Sun;some are closer to it and some are farther away. But the planets do not shine by their ownlight, as the Sun does. They merely reflect light from the Sun. If you were a great distanceaway, you would not see the Earth and the other planets at all; they would be only faintluminous points, lost in the glare of the Sun. Well, then, I thought, it stood to reason thatthe other stars must have planets too, ones we have not yet detected, and some of thoseother planets should have life (why not?), a kind of life probably different from life as weknow it, life in Brooklyn. So I decided I would be an astronomer, learn about the stars andplanets and, if I could, go and visit them.","632":"It has been my immense good fortune to have parents and some teachers whoencouraged this odd ambition and to live in this time, the first moment in human historywhen we are, in fact, visiting other worlds and engaging in a deep reconnaissance of theCosmos. If I had been born in a much earlier age, no matter how great my dedication, Iwould not have understood what the stars and planets are. I would not have known thatthere were other suns and other worlds. This is one of the great secrets, wrested fromNature through a million years of patient observation and courageous thinking by ourancestors.","633":"What are the stars? Such questions are as natural as an infant\u2019s smile. We havealways asked them. What is different about our time is that at last we know some of theanswers. Books and libraries provide a ready means for finding out what those answers are.In biology there is a principle of powerful if imperfect applicability called recapitulation: inour individual embryonic development we retrace the evolutionary history of the species.There is, I think, a kind of recapitulation that occurs in our individual intellectualdevelopments as well. We unconsciously retrace the thoughts of our remote ancestors.Imagine a time before science, a time before libraries. Imagine a time hundreds of","634":"thousands of years ago. We were then just about as smart, just as curious, just as involvedin things social and sexual. But the experiments had not yet been done, the inventions hadnot yet been made. It was the childhood of genus Homo. Imagine the time when fire wasfirst discovered. What were human lives like then? What did out ancestors believe the starswere? Sometimes, in my fantasies, I imagine there was someone who thought like this:","635":"We eat berries and roots. Nuts and leaves. And dead animals. Some animals we find.Some we kill. We know which foods are good and which are dangerous. If we taste somefoods we are struck down, in punishment for eating them. We did not mean to do somethingbad. But foxglove or hemlock can kill you. We love our children and our friends. We warnthem of such foods.","636":"When we hunt animals, then also can we be killed. We can be gored. Or trampled.Or eaten. What animals do means life and death for us: how they behave, what tracks theyleave, their times for mating and giving birth, their times for wandering. We must knowthese things. We tell our children. They will tell their children.","637":"We depend on animals. We follow them - especially in win ter when there are fewplants to eat. We are wandering hunters and gatherers. We call ourselves the hunterfolk.","638":"Most of us fall asleep under the sky or under a tree or in its branches. We useanimal skins for clothing: to keep us warm, to cover our nakedness and sometimes as ahammock. When we wear the animal skins we feel the animal\u2019s power. We leap with thegazelle. We hunt with the bear. There is a bond between us and the animals. We hunt andeat the animals. They hunt and eat us. We are part of one another.","639":"We make tools and stay alive. Some of us are experts at splitting, flaking,sharpening and polishing, as well as finding, rocks. Some rocks we tie with animal sinew toa wooden handle and make an ax. With the ax we strike plants and animals. Other rocksare tied to long sticks. If we are quiet and watchful, we can sometimes come close to ananimal and stick it with the spear.","640":"Meat spoils. Sometimes we are hungry and try not to notice. Sometimes we mixherbs with the bad meat to hide the taste. We fold foods that will not spoil into pieces ofanimal skin. Or big leaves. Or the shell of a large nut. It is wise to put food aside and carryit. If we eat this food too early, some of us will starve later. So we must help one another.For this and many other reasons we have rules. Everyone must obey the rules. We havealways had rules. Rules are sacred.","641":"One day there was a storm, with much lightning and thunder and rain. The littleones are afraid of storms. And sometimes so am I. The secret of the storm is hidden. Thethunder is deep and loud; the lightning is brief and bright. Maybe someone very powerful isvery angry. It must be someone in the sky, I think.","642":"After the storm there was a flickering and crackling in the forest nearby. We went tosee. There was a bright, hot, leaping thing, yellow and red. We had never seen such a thingbefore. We now call it \u2018flame\u2019. It has a special smell. In a way it is alive: It eats food. It eatsplants and tree limbs and even whole trees, if you let it. It is strong. But it is not very smart.If all the food is gone, it dies. It will not walk a spear\u2019s throw from one tree to another ifthere a no food along the way. It cannot walk without eating. But where there is much food,it grows and makes many flame children.","643":"One of us had a brave and fearful thought: to capture the flame, feed it a little, and","644":"make it our friend. We found some long branches of hard wood. The flame was eating them,but slowly. We could pick them up by the end that had no flame. If you run fast with a smallflame, it dies. Their children are weak. We did not run. We walked, shouting good wishes.'Do not die, \u2019 we said to the flame. The other hunterfolk looked with wide eyes.","645":"Ever after, we have carried it with us. We have aflame mother to feed the flameslowly so it does not die of hunger. * Flame is a wonder, and useful too; surely a gift frompowerful beings. Are they the same as the angry beings in the storm ?","646":"* This sense of fire as a living thing, to be protected and cared for, should not be dismissed as a\u2018primitive\u2019 notion. It is to be found near the root of many modern civilizations. Every home in ancient Greeceand Rome and among the Brahmans of ancient India had a hearth and a set of prescribed rules for caring forthe flame. At night the coals were covered with ashes for insulation; in the morning twigs were added torevive the flame. The death of the flame in the hearth was considered synonymous with the death of thefamily. In all three cultures, the hearth ritual was connected with the worship of ancestors. This is the originof the eternal flame, a symbol still widely employed in religious, memorial, political and athletic ceremonialsthroughout the world.","647":"The flame keeps us warm on cold n ights. It gives us light. It makes holes in thedarkness when the Moon is new. We can fix spears at night for tomorrow\u2019s hunt. And if weare not tired, even in the darkness we can see each other and talk. Also - a good thing! -fire keeps animals away. We can be hurt at night. Sometimes we have been eaten, even bysmall animals, hyenas and wolves. Now it is differen t. Now the flame keeps the animalsback. We see them baying softly in the dark, prowling, their eyes glowing in the light of theflame. They are frightened of the flame. But we are not frightened. The flame is ours. Wetake care of the flame. The flame takes care of us.","648":"The sky is importan t. It covers us. It speaks to us. Before the time we found theflame, we would lie back in the dark and look up at all the poin ts of light. Some pointswould come together to make a picture in the sky. One of us could see the pictures betterthan the rest. She taught us the star pictures and what names to call them. We would sitaround late at night and make up stories about the pictures in the sky: lions, dogs, bears,hunterfolk. Other, stranger things. Could they be the pictures of the powerful beings in thesky, the ones who make the storms when angry?","649":"Mostly, the sky does not change. The same star pictures are there year after year.The Moon grows from nothing to a thin sliver to a round ball, and then back again tonothing. When the Moon changes, the women bleed. Some tribes have rules against sex atcertain times in the growing and shrinking of the Moon. Some tribes scratch the days of theMoon or the days that the women bleed on antler bones. They can plan ahead and obeytheir rules. Rules are sacred.","650":"The stars are very far away. When we climb a hill or a tree they are no closer. Andclouds come between us and the stars: the stars must be behind the clouds. The Moon, as itslowly moves, passes in front of stars. Later you can see that the stars are not harmed. TheMoon does not eat stars. The stars must be behind the Moon. They flicker. A strange, cold,white, faraway light. Many of them. All over the sky. But only at night. I wonder what theyare.","651":"After we found the flame, I was sitting near the campfire wondering about the stars.","652":"Slowly a thought came: The stars are flame, I thought. Then I had another thought: Thestars are campfires that other hunterfolk light at night. The stars give a smaller light thancampfires. So the stars must be campfires very far away. \u2018But, \u2019 they ask me, \u2018how can therebe campfires in the sky ? Why do the campfires and the hunter people around those flamesnot fall down at our feet? Why don\u2019t strange tribes drop from the sky?\u2019","653":"Those are good questions. They trouble me. Sometimes I think the sky is half of abig eggshell or a big nutshell. I think the people around those faraway campfires look downat us - except for them it seems up - and say that we are in their sky, and wonder why we donot fall up to them, if you see what I mean. But hunterfolk say, \u2018Down is down and up isup. \u2019 That is a good answer, too.","654":"There is another thought that one of us had. His thought is that night is a greatblack animal skin, thrown up over the sky. There are holes in the skin. We look through theholes. And we see flame. His thought is not just that there is flame in a few places where wesee stars. He thinks there is flame everywhere. He thinks flame covers the whole sky. Butthe skin hides the flame. Except where there are holes.","655":"Some stars wander. Like the animals we hunt. Like us. If you watch with care overmany months, you find they move. There are only five of them, like the fingers on a hand.They wander slowly among the stars. If the campfire thought is true, those stars must betribes of wandering hunterfolk, carrying big fires. But I don\u2019t see how wandering stars canbe holes in a skin. When you make a hole, there it is. A hole is a hole. Holes do not wander.Also, I don\u2019t want to be surrounded by a sky of flame. If the skin fell, the night sky would bebright - too bright - like seeing flame everywhere. I think a sky of flame would eat us all.Maybe there are two kinds of powerful beings in the sky. Bad ones, who wish the flame toeat us. And good ones who put up the skin to keep the flame away. We must find some wayto thank the good ones.","656":"I don\u2019t know if the stars are campfires in the sky. Or holes in a skin through whichthe flame of power looks down on us. Sometimes I think one way. Sometimes 1 think adifferent way. Once I thought there are no campfires and no holes but something else, toohard for me to understand.","657":"Rest your neck on a log. Your head goes back. Then you can see only the sky. Nohills, no trees, no hunterfolk, no campfire. Just sky. Sometimes I feel I may fall up into thesky. If the stars are campfires, I would like to visit those other hunterfolk - the ones whowander. Then I feel good about falling up. But if the stars are holes in a skin, I becomeafraid. 1 don\u2019t want to fall up through a hole and into the flame of power.","658":"I wish I knew which was true. I don\u2019t like not knowing.","659":"I do not imagine that many members of a hunter\/gatherer group had thoughts likethese about the stars. Perhaps, over the ages, a few did, but never all these thoughts in thesame person. Yet, sophisticated ideas are common in such communities. For example,the !Kung* Bushmen of the Kalahari Desert in Botswana have an explanation for the MilkyWay, which at their latitude is often overhead. They call it \u2018the backbone of night,\u2019 as if thesky were some great beast inside which we live. Their explanation makes the Milky Wayuseful as well as understandable. The !Kung believe the Milky Way holds up the night; thatif it were not for the Milky Way, fragments of darkness would come crashing down at ourfeet. It is an elegant idea.","660":"* The exclamation point is a click, made by touching the tongue against the inside of the incisors,and simultaneously pronouncing the K.","661":"Metaphors like those about celestial campfires or galactic backbones wereeventually replaced in most human cultures by another idea: The powerful beings in the skywere promoted to gods. They were given names and relatives, and special responsibilitiesfor the cosmic services they were expected to perform. There was a god or goddess forevery human concern. Gods ran Nature. Nothing could happen without their directintervention. If they were happy, there was plenty of food, and humans were happy. But ifsomething displeased the gods - and sometimes it took very little - the consequences wereawesome: droughts, storms, wars, earthquakes, volcanoes, epidemics. The gods had to bepropitiated, and a vast industry of priests and oracles arose to make the gods less angry. Butbecause the gods were capricious, you could not be sure what they would do. Nature was amystery. It was hard to understand the world.","662":"Little remains of the Heraion on the Aegean isle of Samos, one of the wonders ofthe ancient world, a great temple dedicated to Hera, who began her career as goddess of thesky. She was the patron deity of Samos, playing the same role there as Athena did inAthens. Much later she married Zeus, the chief of the Olympian gods. They honeymoonedon Samos, the old stories tell us. The Greek religion explained that diffuse band of light inthe night sky as the milk of Hera, squirted from her breast across the heavens, a legend thatis the origin of the phrase Westerners still use - the Milky Way. Perhaps it originallyrepresented the important insight that the sky nurtures the Earth; if so, that meaning seemsto have been forgotten millennia ago.","663":"We are, almost all of us, descended from people who responded to the dangers ofexistence by inventing stories about unpredictable or disgruntled deities. For a long timethe human instinct to understand was thwarted by facile religious explanations, as inancient Greece in the time of Homer, where there were gods of the sky and the Earth, thethunderstorm, the oceans and the underworld, fire and time and love and war; where everytree and meadow had its dryad and maenad.","664":"For thousands of years humans were oppressed - as some of us still are - by thenotion that the universe is a marionette whose strings are pulled by a god or gods, unseenand inscrutable. Then, 2,500 years ago, there was a glorious awakening in Ionia: on Samosand the other nearby Greek colonies that grew up among the islands and inlets of the busyeastern Aegean Sea.* Suddenly there were people who believed that everything was madeof atoms; that human beings and other animals had sprung from simpler forms; thatdiseases were not caused by demons or the gods; that the Earth was only a planet goingaround the Sun. And that the stars were very far away.","665":"* As an aid to confusion, Ionia is not in the Ionian Sea; it was named by colonists from the coast ofthe Ionian Sea.","666":"This revolution made Cosmos and Chaos. The early Greeks had believed that thefirst being was Chaos, corresponding to the phrase in Genesis in the same context, \u2018without","667":"form\u2019 . Chaos created and then mated with a goddess called Night, and their offspringeventually produced all the gods and men. A universe created from Chaos was in perfectkeeping with the Greek belief in an unpredictable Nature run by capricious gods. But in thesixth century B.C., in Ionia, a new concept developed, one of the great ideas of the humanspecies. The universe is knowable, the ancient Ionians argued, because it exhibits aninternal order: there are regularities in Nature that permit its secrets to be uncovered. Natureis not entirely unpredictable; there are rules even she must obey. This ordered andadmirable character of the universe was called Cosmos.","668":"But why Ionia, why in these unassuming and pastoral landscapes, these remoteislands and inlets of the Eastern Mediterranean? Why not in the great cities of India orEgypt, Babylonia, China or Mesoamerica? China had an astronomical tradition millenniaold; it invented paper and printing, rockets, clocks, silk, porcelain, and ocean-going navies.Some historians argue it was nevertheless too traditionalist a society, too unwilling to adoptinnovations. Why not India, an extremely rich, mathematically gifted culture? Because,some historians maintain, of a rigid fascination with the idea of an infinitely old universecondemned to an endless cycle of deaths and rebirths, of souls and universes, in whichnothing fundamentally new could ever happen. Why not Mayan and Aztec societies, whichwere accomplished in astronomy and captivated, as the Indians were, by large numbers?Because, some historians declare, they lacked the aptitude or impetus for mechanicalinvention. The Mayans and the Aztecs did not even - except for children\u2019s toys - invent thewheel.","669":"The Ionians had several advantages. Ionia is an island realm. Isolation, even ifincomplete, breeds diversity. With many different islands, there was a variety of politicalsystems. No single concentration of power could enforce social and intellectual conformityin all the islands. Free inquiry became possible. The promotion of superstition was notconsidered a political necessity. Unlike many other cultures, the Ionians were at thecrossroads of civilizations, not at one of the centers. In Ionia, the Phoenician alphabet wasfirst adapted to Greek usage and widespread literacy became possible. Writing was nolonger a monopoly of the priests and scribes. The thoughts of many were available forconsideration and debate. Political power was in the hands of the merchants, who activelypromoted the technology on which their prosperity depended. It was in the EasternMediterranean that African, Asian, and European civilizations, including the great culturesof Egypt and Mesopotamia, met and cross-fertilized in a vigorous and heady confrontationof prejudices, languages, ideas and gods. What do you do when you are faced with severaldifferent gods each claiming the same territory? The Babylonian Marduk and the GreekZeus was each considered master of the sky and king of the gods. You might decide thatMarduk and Zeus were really the same. You might also decide, since they had quitedifferent attributes, that one of them was merely invented by the priests. But if one, why notboth?","670":"And so it was that the great idea arose, the realization that there might be a way toknow the world without the god hypothesis; that there might be principles, forces, laws ofnature, through which the world could be understood without attributing the fall of everysparrow to the direct intervention of Zeus.","671":"China and India and Mesoamerica would, I think, have tumbled to science too, if","672":"only they had been given a little more time. Cultures do not develop with identical rhythmsor evolve in lockstep. They arise at different times and progress at different rates. Thescientific world view works so well, explains so much and resonates so harmoniously withthe most advanced parts of our brains that in time, I think, virtually every culture on theEarth, left to its own devices, would have discovered science. Some culture had to be first.As it turned out, Ionia was the place where science was born.","673":"Between 600 and 400 B.C., this great revolution in human thought began. The keyto the revolution was the hand. Some of the brilliant Ionian thinkers were the sons of sailorsand farmers and weavers. They were accustomed to poking and fixing, unlike the priestsand scribes of other nations, who, raised in luxury, were reluctant to dirty their hands. Theyrejected superstition, and they worked wonders. In many cases we have only fragmentaryor secondhand accounts of what happened. The metaphors used then may be obscure to usnow. There was almost certainly a conscious effort a few centuries later to suppress the newinsights. The leading figures in this revolution were men with Greek names, largelyunfamiliar to us today, but the truest pioneers in the development of our civilization and ourhumanity.","674":"The first Ionian scientist was Thales of Miletus, a city in Asia across a narrowchannel of water from the island of Samos. He had traveled in Egypt and was conversantwith the knowledge of Babylon. It is said that he predicted a solar eclipse. He learned howto measure the height of a pyramid from the length of its shadow and the angle of the Sunabove the horizon, a method employed today to determine the heights of the mountains ofthe Moon. He was the first to prove geometric theorems of the sort codified by Euclid threecenturies later - for example, the proposition that the angles at the base of an isoscelestriangle are equal. There is a clear continuity of intellectual effort from Thales to Euclid toIsaac Newton\u2019s purchase of the Elements of Geometry at Stourbridge Fair in 1663 (Chapter3), the event that precipitated modern science and technology.","675":"Thales attempted to understand the world without invoking the intervention of thegods. Like the Babylonians, he believed the world to have once been water. To explain thedry land, the Babylonians added that Marduk had placed a mat on the face of the waters andpiled dirt upon it.* Thales held a similar view, but, as Benjamin Farrington said, \u2018leftMarduk out.\u2019 Yes, everything was once water, but the Earth formed out of the oceans by anatural process - similar, he thought, to the silting he had observed at the delta of the Nile.Indeed, he thought that water was a common principle underlying all of matter, just astoday we might say the same of electrons, protons and neutrons, or of quarks. WhetherThales\u2019 conclusion was correct is not as important as his approach: The world was notmade by the gods, but instead was the work of material forces interacting in Nature. Thalesbrought back from Babylon and Egypt the seeds of the new sciences of astronomy andgeometry, sciences that would sprout and grow in the fertile soil of Ionia.","676":"* There is some evidence that the antecedent, early Sumerian creation myths were largely naturalisticexplanations, later codified around 1000 B.C. in the Enuma elish (\u2018When on high,\u2019 the first words of thepoem); but by then the gods had replaced Nature, and the myth offers a theogony, not a cosmogony. TheEnuma elish is reminiscent of the Japanese and Ainu myths in which an originally muddy cosmos is beaten bythe wings of a bird, separating the land from the water. A Fijian creation myth says: \u2018Rokomautu created theland. He scooped it up out of the bottom of the ocean in great handfuls and accumulated it in piles here and","677":"there. These are the Fiji Islands.\u2019 The distillation of land from water is a natural enough idea for island andseafaring peoples.","678":"Very little is known about the personal life of Thales, but one revealing anecdote istold by Aristotle in his Politics :","679":"[Thales] was reproached for his poverty, which was supposed to show thatphilosophy is of no use. According to the story, he knew by his skill [in interpretingthe heavens] while it was yet winter that there would be a great harvest of olives inthe coming year; so, having a little money, he gave deposits for the use of all theolive-presses in Chios and Miletus, which he hired at a low price because no onebid against him. When the harvest time came, and many were wanted all at once, helet them out at any rate which he pleased and made a quantity of money. Thus heshowed the world philosophers can easily be rich if they like, but that their ambitionis of another sort.","680":"He was also famous as a political sage, successfully urging the Milesians to resistassimilation by Croesus, King of Lydia, and unsuccessfully urging a federation of all theisland states of Ionia to oppose the Lydians.","681":"Anaximander of Miletus was a friend and colleague of Thales, one of the firstpeople we know of to do an experiment. By examining the moving shadow cast by avertical stick he determined accurately the length of the year and the seasons. For ages menhad used sticks to club and spear one another. Anaximander used one to measure time. Hewas the first person in Greece to make a sundial, a map of the known world and a celestialglobe that showed the patterns of the constellations. He believed the Sun, the Moon and thestars to be made of fire seen through moving holes in the dome of the sky, probably a mucholder idea. He held the remarkable view that the Earth is not suspended or supported fromthe heavens, but that it remains by itself at the center of the universe; since it wasequidistant from all places on the \u2018celestial sphere,\u2019 there was no force that could move it.","682":"He argued that we are so helpless at birth that, if the first human infants had beenput into the world on their own, they would immediately have died. From thisAnaximander concluded that human beings arose from other animals with more self-reliantnewborns: He proposed the spontaneous origin of life in mud, the first animals being fishcovered with spines. Some descendants of these fishes eventually abandoned the water andmoved to dry land, where they evolved into other animals by the transmutation of one forminto another. He believed in an infinite number of worlds, all inhabited, and all subject tocycles of dissolution and regeneration. \u2018Nor\u2019, as Saint Augustine ruefully complained, \u2018didhe, any more than Thales, attribute the cause of all this ceaseless activity to a divine mind.\u2019In the year 540 B.C. or thereabouts, on the island of Samos, there came to power atyrant named Polycrates. He seems to have started as a caterer and then gone on tointernational piracy. Polycrates was a generous patron of the arts, sciences and engineering.But he oppressed his own people; he made war on his neighbors; he quite rightly fearedinvasion. So he surrounded his capital city with a massive wall, about six kilometers long,whose remains stand to this day. To carry water from a distant spring through the","683":"fortifications, he ordered a great tunnel built. A kilometer long, it pierces a mountain. Twocuttings were dug from either end which met almost perfectly in the middle. The projecttook about fifteen years to complete, a testament to the civil engineering of the day and anindication of the extraordinary practical capability of the Ionians. But there is another andmore ominous side to the enterprise: it was built in part by slaves in chains, many capturedby the pirate ships of Polycrates.","684":"This was the time of Theodorus, the master engineer of the age, credited among theGreeks with the invention of the key, the ruler, the carpenter\u2019s square, the level, the lathe,bronze casting and central heating. Why are there no monuments to this man? Those whodreamed and speculated about the laws of Nature talked with the technologists and theengineers. They were often the same people. The theoretical and the practical were one.","685":"About the same time, on the nearby island of Cos, Hippocrates was establishing hisfamous medical tradition, now barely remembered because of the Hippocratic oath. It was apractical and effective school of medicine, which Hippocrates insisted had to be based onthe contemporary equivalent of physics and chemistry.* But it also had its theoretical side.In his book On Ancient Medicine, Hippocrates wrote: \u2018Men think epilepsy divine, merelybecause they do not understand it. But if they called everything divine which they do notunderstand, why, there would be no end of divine things.\u2019","686":"* And astrology, which was then widely regarded as a science. In a typical passage, Hippocrateswrites: \u2018One must also guard against the risings of the stars, especially of the Dog Star [Sirius], then ofArcturus, and also of the setting of the Pleiades.\u2019","687":"In time, the Ionian influence and the experimental method spread to the mainland ofGreece, to Italy, to Sicily. There was once a time when hardly anyone believed in air. Theyknew about breathing, of course, and they thought the wind was the breath of the gods. Butthe idea of air as a static, material but invisible substance was unimagined. The firstrecorded experiment on air was performed by a physician* named Empedocles, whoflourished around 450 B.C. Some accounts claim he identified himself as a god. Butperhaps it was only that he was so clever that others thought him a god. He believed thatlight travels very fast, but not infinitely fast. He taught that there was once a much greatervariety of living things on the Earth, but that many races of beings \u2018must have been unableto beget and continue their kind. For in the case of every species that exists, either craft orcourage or speed has from the beginning of its existence protected and preserved it.\u2019 In thisattempt to explain the lovely adaptation of organisms to their environments, Empedocles,like Anaximander and Democritus (see below), clearly anticipated some aspects ofDarwin\u2019s great idea of evolution by natural selection.","688":"* The experiment was performed in support of a totally erroneous theory of the circulation of theblood, but the idea of performing any experiment to probe Nature is the important innovation.","689":"Empedocles performed his experiment with a household implement people had usedfor centuries, the so-called clepsydra or \u2018water thief\u2019, which was used as a kitchen ladle. Abrazen sphere with an open neck and small holes in the bottom, it is filled by immersing it","690":"in water. If you pull it out with the neck uncovered, the water pours out of the holes,making a little shower. But if you pull it out properly, with your thumb covering the neck,the water is retained within the sphere until you lift your thumb. If you try to fill it with theneck covered, nothing happens. Some material substance must be in the way of the water.We cannot see such a substance. What could it be? Empedocles argued that it could only beair. A thing we cannot see can exert pressure, can frustrate my wish to fill a vessel withwater if I were dumb enough to leave my finger on the neck. Empedocles had discoveredthe invisible. Air, he thought, must be matter in a form so finely divided that it could not beseen.","691":"Empedocles is said to have died in an apotheotic fit by leaping into the hot lava atthe summit caldera of the great volcano of Aetna. But I sometimes imagine that he merelyslipped during a courageous and pioneering venture in observational geophysics.","692":"This hint, this whiff, of the existence of atoms was carried much further by a mannamed Democritus, who came from the Ionian colony of Abdera in northern Greece.","693":"Abdera was a kind of joke town. If in 430 B.C. you told a story about someone fromAbdera, you were guaranteed a laugh. It was in a way the Brooklyn of its time. ForDemocritus all of life was to be enjoyed and understood; understanding and enjoymentwere the same thing. He said that \u2018a life without festivity is a long road without an inn.\u2019Democritus may have come from Abdera, but he was no dummy. He believed that a largenumber of worlds had formed spontaneously out of diffuse matter in space, evolved andthen decayed. At a time when no one knew about impact craters, Democritus thought thatworlds on occasion collide; he believed that some worlds wandered alone through thedarkness of space, while others were accompanied by several suns and moons; that someworlds were inhabited, while others had no plants or animals or even water; that thesimplest forms of life arose from a kind of primeval ooze. He taught that perception - thereason, say, I think there is a pen in my hand - was a purely physical and mechanisticprocess; that thinking and feeling were attributes of matter put together in a sufficiently fineand complex way and not due to some spirit infused into matter by the gods.","694":"Democritus invented the word atom , Greek for \u2018unable to be cut.\u2019 Atoms were theultimate particles, forever frustrating our attempts to break them into smaller pieces.Everything, he said, is a collection of atoms, intricately assembled. Even we. \u2018Nothingexists,\u2019 he said, \u2018but atoms and the void.\u2019","695":"When we cut an apple, the knife must pass through empty spaces between the atoms,Democritus argued. If there were no such empty spaces, no void, the knife would encounterthe impenetrable atoms, and the apple could not be cut. Having cut a slice from a cone, say,let us compare the cross sections of the two pieces. Are the exposed areas equal? No, saidDemocritus. The slope of the cone forces one side of the slice to have a slightly smallercross section than the other. If the two areas were exactly equal, we would have a cylinder,not a cone. No matter how sharp the knife, the two pieces have unequal cross sections.Why? Because, on the scale of the very small, matter exhibits some irreducible roughness.This fine scale of roughness Democritus identified with the world of the atoms. Hisarguments were not those we use today, but they were subtle and elegant, derived fromeveryday life. And his conclusions were fundamentally correct.","696":"In related exercise. Democritus imagined calculating the volume of a cone or a","697":"pyramid by a very large number of extremely small stacked plates tapering in size from thebase to the apex. He had stated the problem that, in mathematics, is called the theory oflimits. He was knocking at the door of the differential and integral calculus, thatfundamental tool for understanding the world that was not, so far as we know from writtenrecords, in fact discovered until the time of Isaac Newton. Perhaps if Democritus\u2019 work hadnot been almost completely destroyed, there would have been calculus by the time ofChrist.*","698":"* The frontiers of the calculus were also later breached by Eudoxus and Archimedes.","699":"Thomas Wright marveled in 1750 that Democritus had believed the Milky Way tobe composed mainly of unresolved stars: \u2018long before astronomy reaped any benefit fromthe improved sciences of optics; [he] saw, as we may say, through the eye of reason, full asfar into infinity as the most able astronomers in more advantageous times have done since.\u2019Beyond the Milk of Hera, past the Backbone of Night, the mind of Democritus soared.","700":"As a person, Democritus seems to have been somewhat unusual. Women, childrenand sex discomfited him, in part because they took time away from thinking. But he valuedfriendship, held cheerfulness to be the goal of life and devoted a major philosophicalinquiry to the origin and nature of enthusiasm. He journeyed to Athens to visit Socrates andthen found himself too shy to introduce himself. He was a close friend of Hippocrates. Hewas awed by the beauty and elegance of the physical world. He felt that poverty in ademocracy was preferable to wealth in a tyranny. He believed that the prevailing religionsof his time were evil and that neither immortal souls nor immortal gods exist: \u2018Nothingexists, but atoms and the void.\u2019","701":"There is no record of Democritus having been persecuted for his opinions - but then,he came from Abdera. However, in his time the brief tradition of tolerance forunconventional views began to erode and then to shatter. People came to be punished forhaving unusual ideas. A portrait of Democritus is now on the Greek hundred-drachma bill.But his insights were suppressed, his influence on history made minor. The mystics werebeginning to win.","702":"Anaxagoras was an Ionian experimentalist who flourished around 450 B.C. andlived in Athens. He was a rich man, indifferent to his wealth but passionate about science.Asked what was the purpose of life, he replied, \u2018the investigation of the Sun, the Moon, andthe heavens,\u2019 the reply of a true astronomer. He performed a clever experiment in which asingle drop of white liquid, like cream, was shown not to lighten perceptibly the contents ofa great pitcher of dark liquid, like wine. There must, he concluded, be changes deducible byexperiment that are too subtle to be perceived directly by the senses.","703":"Anaxagoras was not nearly so radical as Democritus. Both were thoroughgoingmaterialists, not in prizing possessions but in holding that matter alone provided theunderpinnings of the world. Anaxagoras believed in a special mind substance anddisbelieved in the existence of atoms. He thought humans were more intelligent than otheranimals because of our hands, a very Ionian idea.","704":"He was the first person to state clearly that the Moon shines by reflected light, andhe accordingly devised a theory of the phases of the Moon. This doctrine was so dangerous","705":"that the manuscript describing it had to be circulated in secret, an Athenian samizdat. It wasnot in keeping with the prejudices of the time to explain the phases or eclipses of the Moonby the relative geometry of the Earth, the Moon and the self-luminous Sun. Aristotle, twogenerations later, was content to argue that those things happened because it was the natureof the Moon to have phases and eclipses - mere verbal juggling, an explanation thatexplains nothing.","706":"The prevailing belief was that the Sun and Moon were gods. Anaxagoras held thatthe Sun and stars are fiery stones. We do not feel the heat of the stars because they are toofar away. He also thought that the Moon has mountains (right) and inhabitants (wrong). Heheld that the Sun was so huge that it was probably larger than the Peloponnesus, roughlythe southern third of Greece. His critics thought this estimate excessive and absurd.","707":"Anaxagoras was brought to Athens by Pericles, its leader in its time of greatestglory, but also the man whose actions led to the Peloponnesian War, which destroyedAthenian democracy. Pericles delighted in philosophy and science, and Anaxagoras wasone of his principal confidants. There are those who think that in this role Anaxagorascontributed significantly to the greatness of Athens. But Pericles had political problems. Hewas too powerful to be attacked directly, so his enemies attacked those close to him.Anaxagoras was convicted and imprisoned for the religious crime of impiety - because hehad taught that the Moon was made of ordinary matter, that it was a place, and that the Sunwas a red-hot stone in the sky. Bishop John Wilkins commented in 1638 on theseAthenians: \u2018Those zealous idolators [counted] it a great blasphemy to make their God astone, whereas notwithstanding they were so senseless in their adoration of idols as to makea stone their God.\u2019 Pericles seems to have engineered Anaxagoras\u2019 release from prison, butit was too late. In Greece the tide was turning, although the Ionian tradition continued inAlexandrian Egypt two hundred years later.","708":"The great scientists from Thales to Democritus and Anaxagoras have usually beendescribed in history or philosophy books as \u2018Presocratics\u2019, as if their main function was tohold the philosophical fort until the advent of Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle and perhapsinfluence them a little. Instead, the old Ionians represent a different and largelycontradictory tradition, one in much better accord with modern science. That their influencewas felt powerfully for only two or three centuries is an irreparable loss for all those humanbeings who lived between the Ionian Awakening and the Italian Renaissance.","709":"Perhaps the most influential person ever associated with Samos was Pythagoras,* acontemporary of Polycrates in the sixth century B.C. According to local tradition, he livedfor a time in a cave on the Samian Mount Kerkis, and was the first person in the history ofthe world to deduce that the Earth is a sphere. Perhaps he argued by analogy with the Moonand the Sun, or noticed the curved shadow of the Earth on the Moon during a lunar eclipse,or recognized that when ships leave Samos and recede over the horizon, their mastsdisappear last.","710":"* The sixth century B.C. was a time of remarkable intellectual and spiritual ferment across the planet.Not only was it the time of Thales, Anaximander, Pythagoras and others in Ionia, but also the time of theEgyptian Pharaoh Necho who caused Africa to be circumnavigated, of Zoroaster in Persia, Confucius andLao-tse in China, the Jewish prophets in Israel, Egypt and Babylon, and Gautama Buddha in India. It is hard","711":"to think these activities altogether unrelated.","712":"He or his disciples discovered the Pythagorean theorem: the sum of the squares ofthe shorter sides of a right triangle equals the square of the longer side. Pythagoras did notsimply enumerate examples of this theorem; he developed a method of mathematicaldeduction to prove the thing generally. The modern tradition of mathematical argument,essential to all of science, owes much to Pythagoras. It was he who first used the wordCosmos to denote a well-ordered and harmonious universe, a world amenable to humanunderstanding.","713":"Many Ionians believed the underlying harmony of the universe to be accessiblethrough observation and experiment, the method that dominates science today. However,Pythagoras employed a very different method. He taught that the laws of Nature could bededuced by pure thoughts. He and his followers were not fundamentally experimentalists.*They were mathematicians. And they were thoroughgoing mystics. According to BertrandRussell, in a perhaps uncharitable passage, Pythagoras \u2018founded a religion, of which themain tenets were the transmigration of souls and the sinfulness of eating beans. His religionwas embodied in a religious order, which, here and there, acquired control of the State andestablished a rule of the saints. But the unregenerate hankered after beans, and sooner orlater rebelled.\u2019","714":"* Although there were a few welcome exceptions. The Pythagorean fascination with whole -numberratios in musical harmonies seems clearly to be based on observation, or even experiment on the soundsissued from plucked strings. Empedocles was, at least in part, a Pythagorean. One of Pythagoras\u2019 students,Alcmaeon, is the first person known to have dissected a human body; he distinguished between arteries andveins, was the first to discover the optic nerve and the eustachian tubes, and identified the brain as the seat ofthe intellect (a contention later denied by Aristotle, who placed intelligence in the heart, and then revived byHerophilus of Chalcedon). He also founded the science of embryology. But Alcmaeon\u2019s zest for the impurewas not shared by most of his Pythagorean colleagues in later times.","715":"The Pythagoreans delighted in the certainty of mathematical demonstration, thesense of a pure and unsullied world accessible to the human intellect, a Cosmos in whichthe sides of right triangles perfectly obey simple mathematical relationships. It was instriking contrast to the messy reality of the workaday world. They believed that in theirmathematics they had glimpsed a perfect reality, a realm of the gods, of which our familiarworld is but an imperfect reflection. In Plato\u2019s famous parable of the cave, prisoners wereimagined tied in such a way that they saw only the shadows of passersby and believed theshadows to be real - never guessing the complex reality that was accessible if they wouldbut turn their heads. The Pythagoreans would powerfully influence Plato and, later,Christianity.","716":"They did not advocate the free confrontation of conflicting points of view. Instead,like all orthodox religions, they practiced a rigidity that prevented them from correctingtheir errors. Cicero wrote:","717":"In discussion it is not so much weight of authority as force of argument that should","718":"be demanded. Indeed, the authority of those who profess to teach is often a positive","719":"hindrance to those who desire to learn; they cease to employ their own judgment,and take what they perceive to be the verdict of their chosen master as settling thequestion. In fact I am not disposed to approve the practice traditionally ascribed tothe Pythagoreans, who, when questioned as to the grounds of any assertion that theyadvanced in debate, are said to have been accustomed to reply \u2018The Master said so,\u2019\u2018the Master\u2019 being Pythagoras. So potent was an opinion already decided, makingauthority prevail unsupported by reason.","720":"The Pythagoreans were fascinated by the regular solids, symmetrical three-dimensionalobjects all of whose sides are the same regular polygon. The cube is the simplest example,having six squares as sides. There are an infinite number of regular polygons, but only fiveregular solids. (The proof of this statement, a famous example of mathematical reasoning,is given in Appendix 2.) For some reason, knowledge of a solid called the dodecahedronhaving twelve pentagons as sides seemed to them dangerous. It was mystically associatedwith the Cosmos. The other four regular solids were identified, somehow, with the four\u2018elements\u2019 then imagined to constitute the world: earth, fire, air and water. The fifth regularsolid must then, they thought, correspond to some fifth element that could only be thesubstance of the heavenly bodies. (This notion of a fifth essence is the origin of our wordquintessence.) Ordinary people were to be kept ignorant of the dodecahedron.","721":"In love with whole numbers, the Pythagoreans believed all things could be derivedfrom them, certainly all other numbers. A crisis in doctrine arose when they discovered thatthe square root of two (the ratio of the diagonal to the side of a square) was irrational, that itcannot be expressed accurately as the ratio of any two whole numbers, no matter how bigthese numbers are. Ironically this discovery (reproduced in Appendix 1) was made with thePythagorean theorem as a tool. \u2018Irrational\u2019 originally meant only that a number could not beexpressed as a ratio. But for the Pythagoreans it came to mean something threatening, a hintthat their world view might not make sense, which is today the other meaning of\u2018irrational.\u2019 Instead of sharing these important mathematical discoveries, the Pythagoreanssuppressed knowledge of the square root of two and the dodecahedron. The outside worldwas not to know.* Even today there are scientists opposed to the popularization of science:the sacred knowledge is to be kept within the cult, unsullied by public understanding.","722":"* A Pythagorean named Hippasus published the secret of the \u2018sphere with twelve pentagons\u2019, thedodecahedron. When he later died in a shipwreck, we are told, his fellow Pythagoreans remarked on thejustice of the punishment. His book has not survived.","723":"The Pythagoreans believed the sphere to be \u2018perfect\u2019, all points on its surface beingat the same distance from its center. Circles were also perfect. And the Pythagoreansinsisted that planets moved in circular paths at constant speeds. They seemed to believe thatmoving slower or faster at different places in the orbit would be unseemly; noncircularmotion was somehow flawed, unsuitable for the planets, which, being free of the Earth,were also deemed \u2018perfect.\u2019","724":"The pros and cons of the Pythagorean tradition can be seen clearly in the life\u2019s workof Johannes Kepler (Chapter 3). The Pythagorean idea of a perfect and mystical world,","725":"unseen by the senses, was readily accepted by the early Christians and was an integralcomponent of Kepler\u2019s early training. On the one hand, Kepler was convinced thatmathematical harmonies exist in nature (he wrote that \u2018the universe was stamped with theadornment of harmonic proportions\u2019); that simple numerical relationships must determinethe motion of the planets. On the other hand, again following the Pythagoreans, he longbelieved that only uniform circular motion was admissible. He repeatedly found theobserved planetary motions could not be explained in this way, and repeatedly tried again.But unlike many Pythagoreans, he believed in observations and experiment in the realworld. Eventually the detailed observations of the apparent motion of the planets forcedhim to abandon the idea of circular paths and to realize that planets travel in ellipses.","726":"Kepler was both inspired in his search for the harmony of planetary motion and delayed formore than a decade by the attractions of Pythagorean doctrine.","727":"A disdain for the practical swept the ancient world. Plato urged astronomers to thinkabout the heavens, but not to waste their time observing them. Aristotle believed that: \u2018Thelower sort are by nature slaves, and it is better for them as for all inferiors that they shouldbe under the rule of a master .... The slave shares in his master\u2019s life; the artisan is lessclosely connected with him, and only attains excellence in proportion as he becomes a slave.The meaner sort of mechanic has a special and separate slavery.\u2019 Plutarch wrote: \u2018It doesnot of necessity follow that, if the work delight you with its grace, the one who wrought itis worthy of esteem.\u2019 Xenophon\u2019s opinion was: \u2018What are called the mechanical arts carry asocial stigma and are rightly dishonoured in our cities.\u2019 As a result of such attitudes, thebrilliant and promising Ionian experimental method was largely abandoned for twothousand years. Without experiment, there is no way to choose among contendinghypotheses, no way for science to advance. The antiempirical taint of the Pythagoreanssurvives to this day. But why? Where did this distaste for experiment come from?","728":"An explanation for the decline of ancient science has been put forward by thehistorian of science, Benjamin Farrington: The mercantile tradition, which led to Ionianscience, also led to a slave economy. The owning of slaves was the road to wealth andpower. Polycrates\u2019 fortifications were built by slaves. Athens in the time of Pericles, Platoand Aristotle had a vast slave population. All the brave Athenian talk about democracyapplied only to a privileged few. What slaves characteristically perform is manual labor.","729":"But scientific experimentation is manual labor, from which the slaveholders arepreferentially distanced; while it is only the slaveholders - politely called \u2018gentle-men\u2019 insome societies - who have the leisure to do science. Accordingly, almost no one did science.The Ionians were perfectly able to make machines of some elegance. But the availability ofslaves undermined the economic motive for the development of technology. Thus themercantile tradition contributed to the great Ionian awakening around 600 B.C., and,through slavery, may have been the cause of its decline some two centuries later. There aregreat ironies here.","730":"Similar trends are apparent throughout the world. The high point in indigenousChinese astronomy occurred around 1280, with the work of Kuo Shou-ching, who used anobservational baseline of 1,500 years and improved both astronomical instruments andmathematical techniques for computation. It is generally thought that Chinese astronomythereafter underwent a steep decline. Nathan Sivin believes that the reason lies at least","731":"partly \u2018in increasing rigidity of elite attitudes, so that the educated were less inclined to becurious about techniques and less willing to value science as an appropriate pursuit for agentleman.\u2019 The occupation of astronomer became a hereditary office, a practiceinconsistent with the advance of the subject. Additionally, \u2018the responsibility for theevolution of astronomy remained centered in the Imperial Court and was largely abandonedto foreign technicians,\u2019 chiefly the Jesuits, who had introduced Euclid and Copernicus tothe astonished Chinese, but who, after the censorship of the latter\u2019s book, had a vestedinterest in disguising and suppressing heliocentric cosmology. Perhaps science wasstillborn in Indian, Mayan and Aztec civilizations for the same reason it declined in Ionia,the pervasiveness of the slave economy. A major problem in the contemporary (political)Third World is that the educated classes tend to be the children of the wealthy, with avested interest in the status quo, and are unaccustomed either to working with their handsor to challenging conventional wisdom. Science has been very slow to take root.","732":"Plato and Aristotle were comfortable in a slave society. They offered justificationsfor oppression. They served tyrants. They taught the alienation of the body from the mind(a natural enough ideal in a slave society); they separated matter from thought; theydivorced the Earth from the heavens - divisions that were to dominate Western thinking formore than twenty centuries. Plato, who believed that \u2018all things are full of gods,\u2019 actuallyused the metaphor of slavery to connect his politics with his cosmology. He is said to haveurged the burning of all the books of Democritus (he had a similar recommendation for thebooks of Homer), perhaps because Democritus did not acknowledge immortal souls orimmortal gods or Pythagorean mysticism, or because he believed in an infinite number ofworlds. Of the seventy-three books Democritus is said to have written, covering all ofhuman knowledge, not a single work survives. All we know is from fragments, chiefly onethics, and secondhand accounts. The same is true of almost all the other ancient Ionianscientists.","733":"In the recognition by Pythagoras and Plato that the Cosmos is knowable, that thereis a mathematical underpinning to nature, they greatly advanced the cause of science. Butin the suppression of disquieting facts, the sense that science should be kept for a small elite,the distaste for experiment, the embrace of mysticism and the easy acceptance of slavesocieties, they set back the human enterprise. After a long mystical sleep in which the toolsof scientific inquiry lay moldering, the Ionian approach, in some cases transmitted throughscholars at the Alexandrian Library, was finally rediscovered. The Western worldreawakened. Experiment and open inquiry became once more respectable. Forgotten booksand fragments were again read. Leonardo and Columbus and Copernicus were inspired byor independently retraced parts of this ancient Greek tradition. There is in our time muchIonian science, although not in politics and religion, and a fair amount of courageous freeinquiry. But there are also appalling superstitions and deadly ethical ambiguities. We areflawed by ancient contradictions.","734":"The Platonists and their Christian successors held the peculiar notion that the Earthwas tainted and somehow nasty, while the heavens were perfect and divine. Thefundamental idea that the Earth is a planet, that we are citizens of the Universe, wasrejected and forgotten. This idea was first argued by Aristarchus, born on Samos threecenturies after Pythagoras. Aristarchus was one of the last of the Ionian scientists. By this","735":"time, the center of intellectual enlightenment had moved to the great Library of Alexandria.Aristarchus was the first person to hold that the Sun rather than the Earth is at the center ofthe planetary system, that all the planets go around the Sun rather than the Earth. Typically,his writings on this matter are lost. From the size of the Earth\u2019 s shadow on the Moon duringa lunar eclipse, he deduced that the Sun had to be much larger than the Earth, as well asvery far away. He may then have reasoned that it is absurd for so large a body as the Sun torevolve around so small a body as the Earth. He put the Sun at the center, made the Earthrotate on its axis once a day and orbit the Sun once a year.","736":"It is the same idea we associate with the name of Copernicus, whom Galileodescribed as the \u2018restorer and confirmer\u2019, not the inventor, of the heliocentric hypothesis.*For most of the 1,800 years between Aristarchus and Copernicus nobody knew the correctdisposition of the planets, even though it had been laid out perfectly clearly around 280 B.CThe idea outraged some of Aristarchus\u2019 contemporaries. There were cries, like those voicedabout Anaxagoras and Bruno and Galileo, that he be condemned for impiety. The resistanceto Aristarchus and Copernicus, a kind of geocentrism in everyday life, remains with us: westill talk about the Sun \u2018rising\u2019 and the Sun \u2018setting\u2019. It is 2,200 years since Aristarchus, andour language still pretends that the Earth does not turn.","737":"* Copernicus may have gotten the idea from reading about Aristarchus. Recently discoveredclassical texts were a source of great excitement in Italian universities when Copernicus went to medicalschool there. In the manuscript of his book, Copernicus mentioned Aristarchus\u2019 priority, but he omitted thecitation before the book saw print. Copernicus wrote in a letter to Pope Paul III: \u2018According to Cicero, Nicetashad thought the Earth was moved . . . According to Plutarch [who discusses Aristarchusl... certain others hadheld the same opinion. When from this, therefore, I had conceived its possibility, I myself also began tomeditate upon the mobility of the Earth.\u2019","738":"The separation of the planets from one another - forty million kilometers from Earthto Venus at closest approach, six billion kilometers to Pluto - would have stunned thoseGreeks who were outraged by the contention that the Sun might be as large as thePeloponnesus. It was natural to think of the solar system as much more compact and local.If I hold my finger before my eyes and examine it first with my left and then with my righteye, it seems to move against the distant background. The closer my finger is, the more itseems to move. I can estimate the distance to my finger from the amount of this apparentmotion, or parallax. If my eyes were farther apart, my finger would seem to movesubstantially more. The longer the baseline from which we make our two observations, thegreater the parallax and the better we can measure the distance to remote objects. But welive on a moving platform, the Earth, which every six months has progressed from one endof its orbit to the other, a distance of 300,000,000 kilometers. If we look at the sameunmoving celestial object six months apart, we should be able to measure very greatdistances. Aristarchus suspected the stars to be distant suns. He placed the Sun \u2018among\u2019 thefixed stars. The absence of detectable stellar parallax as the Earth moved suggested that thestars were much farther away than the Sun. Before the invention of the telescope, theparallax of even the nearest stars was too small to detect. Not until the nineteenth centurywas the parallax of a star first measured. It then became clear, from straightforward Greekgeometry, that the stars were light-years away.","739":"There is another way to measure the distance to the stars which the Ionians werefully capable of discovering, although, so far as we know, they did not employ it. Everyoneknows that the farther away an object is, the smaller it seems. This inverse proportionalitybetween apparent size and distance is the basis of perspective in art and photography. Sothe farther away we are from the Sun, the smaller and dimmer it appears. How far wouldwe have to be from the Sun for it to appear as small and as dim as a star? Or, equivalently,how small a piece of the Sun would be as bright as a star?","740":"An early experiment to answer this question was performed by Christiaan Huygens,very much in the Ionian tradition. Huygens drilled small holes in a brass plate, held theplate up to the Sun and asked himself which hole seemed as bright as he remembered thebright star Sirius to have been the night before. The hole was effectively* 1\/28,000 theapparent size of the Sun. So Sirius, he reasoned, must be 28,000 times farther from us thanthe Sun, or about half a light-year away. It is hard to remember just how bright a star ismany hours after you look at it, but Huygens remembered very well. If he had known thatSirius was intrinsically brighter than the Sun, he would have come up with almost exactlythe right answer: Sirius is 8.8 light-years away. The fact that Aristarchus and Huygens usedimprecise data and derived imperfect answers hardly matters. They explained their methodsso clearly that, when better observations were available, more accurate answers could bederived.","741":"* Huygens actually used a glass bead to reduce the amount of light passed by the hole.","742":"Between the times of Aristarchus and Huygens, humans answered the question thathad so excited me as a boy growing up in Brooklyn: What are the stars? The answer is thatthe stars are mighty suns, light-years away in the vastness of interstellar space.","743":"The great legacy of Aristarchus is this: neither we nor our planet enjoys a privilegedposition in Nature. This insight has since been applied upward to the stars, and sideways tomany subsets of the human family, with great success and invariable opposition. It has beenresponsible for major advances in astronomy, physics, biology, anthropology, economicsand politics. I wonder if its social extrapolation is a major reason for attempts at itssuppression.","744":"The legacy of Aristarchus has been extended far beyond the realm of the stars. Atthe end of the eighteenth century, William Herschel, musician and astronomer to George IIIof England, completed a project to map the starry skies and found apparently equalnumbers of stars in all directions in the plane or band of the Milky Way; from this,reasonably enough, he deduced that we were at the center of the Galaxy.* Just beforeWorld War I, Harlow Shapley of Missouri devised a technique for measuring the distancesto the globular clusters, those lovely spherical arrays of stars which resemble a swarm ofbees. Shapley had found a stellar standard candle, a star noticeable because of its variability,but which had always the same average intrinsic brightness. By comparing the faintness ofsuch stars when found in globular clusters with their real brightness, as determined fromnearby representatives, Shapley could calculate how far away they are - just as, in a field,we can estimate the distance of a lantern of known intrinsic brightness from the feeble lightthat reaches us - essentially, the method of Huygens. Shapley discovered that the globular","745":"clusters were not centered around the solar neighborhood but rather about a distant regionof the Milky Way, in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius, the Archer. It seemed tohim very likely that the globular clusters used in this investigation, nearly a hundred ofthem, would be orbiting about, paying homage to, the massive center of the Milky Way.","746":"* This supposed privileged position of the Earth, at the center of what was then considered theknown universe, led A. R. Wallace to the anti-Aristarchian position, in his book Man 's Place in the Universe(1903), that ours may be the only inhabited planet.","747":"Shapley had in 1915 the courage to propose that the solar system was in theoutskirts and not near the core of our galaxy. Herschel had been misled because of thecopious amount of obscuring dust in the direction of Sagittarius; he had no way to know ofthe enormous numbers of stars beyond. It is now very clear that we live some 30,000light-years from the galactic core, on the fringes of a spiral arm, where the local density ofstars is relatively sparse. There may be those who live on a planet that orbits a central starin one of Shapley\u2019 s globular clusters, or one located in the core. Such beings may pity usfor our handful of naked-eye stars, because their skies will be ablaze with them. Near thecenter of the Milky Way, millions of brilliant stars would be visible to the naked eye,compared to our paltry few thousand. Our Sun or suns might set, but the night would nevercome.","748":"Well into the twentieth century, astronomers believed that there was only onegalaxy in the Cosmos, the Milky Way - although in the eighteenth century Thomas Wrightof Durban and Immanuel Kant of Konigsberg each had a premonition that the exquisiteluminous spiral forms, viewed through the telescope, were other galaxies. Kant suggestedexplicitly that M3 1 in the constellation Andromeda was another Milky Way, composed ofenormous numbers of stars, and proposed calling such objects by the evocative andhaunting phrase \u2018island universes.\u2019 Some scientists toyed with the idea that the spiralnebulae were not distant island universes but rather nearby condensing clouds of interstellargas, perhaps on their way to make solar systems. To test the distance of the spiral nebula aclass of intrinsically much brighter variable stars was needed to furnish a new standardcandle. Such stars, identified in M31 by Edwin Hubble in 1924, were discovered to bealarmingly dim, and it became apparent that M3 1 was a prodigious distance away, anumber now estimated at a little more than two million light-years. But if M31 were at sucha distance, it could not be a cloud of mere interstellar dimensions; it had to be much larger -an immense galaxy in its own right. And the other, fainter galaxies must be more distantstill, a hundred billion of them, sprinkled through the dark to the frontiers of the knownCosmos.","749":"As long as there have been humans, we have searched for our place in the Cosmos. In thechildhood of our species (when our ancestors gazed a little idly at the stars), among theIonian scientists of ancient Greece, and in our own age, we have been transfixed by thisquestion: Where are we? Who are we? We find that we live on an insignificant planet of ahumdrum star lost between two spiral arms in the outskirts of a galaxy which is a memberof a sparse cluster of galaxies, tucked away in some forgotten corner of a universe in which","750":"there are far more galaxies than people. This perspective is a courageous continuation ofour penchant for constructing and testing mental models of the skies; the Sun as a red-hotstone, the stars as celestial flame, the Galaxy as the backbone of night.","751":"Since Aristarchus, every step in our quest has moved us farther from center stage inthe cosmic drama. There has not been much time to assimilate these new findings. Thediscoveries of Shapley and Hubble were made within the lifetimes of many people stillalive today. There are those who secretly deplore these great discoveries, who considerevery step a demotion, who in their heart of hearts still pine for a universe whose center,focus and fulcrum is the Earth. But if we are to deal with the Cosmos we must firstunderstand it, even if our hopes for some unearned preferential status are, in the process,contravened. Understanding where we live is an essential precondition for improving theneighborhood. Knowing what other neighborhoods are like also helps. If we long for ourplanet to be important, there is something we can do about it. We make our worldsignificant by the courage of our questions and by the depth of our answers.","752":"We embarked on our cosmic voyage with a question first framed in the childhood ofour species and in each generation asked anew with undiminished wonder: What are thestars? Exploration is in our nature. We began as wanderers, and we are wanderers still. Wehave lingered long enough on the shores of the cosmic ocean. We are ready at last to setsail for the stars.","753":"Travels in Space and Time","754":"No one has lived longer than a dead child, and Methusula* died young.

But the number of stars we can see is only thetiniest fraction of the number of stars that are. What we see at night is the merestsmattering of the nearest stars. Meanwhile the Cosmos is rich beyond measure: the totalnumber of stars in the universe is greater than all the grains of sand on all the beaches of theplanet Earth.","764":"Despite the efforts of ancient astronomers and astrologers to put pictures in the skies,a constellation is nothing more than an arbitrary grouping of stars composed of intrinsicallydim stars that seem to us bright because they are nearby, and intrinsically brighter stars thatare somewhat more distant. All places on Earth are, to high precision, the same distancefrom any star. This is why the star patterns in a given constellation do not change as we gofrom, say, Soviet Central Asia to the American Midwest. Astronomically, the U.S.S.R. andthe United States are the same place. The stars in any constellation are all so far away thatwe cannot recognize them as a three-dimensional configuration as long as we are tied toEarth. The average distance between the stars is a few light-years, a light-year being, weremember, about ten trillion kilometers. For the patterns of the constellations to change, wemust travel over distances comparable to those that separate the stars; we must ventureacross the light-years. Then some nearby stars will seem to move out of the constellation,others will enter it, and its configuration will alter dramatically.","765":"Our technology is, so far, utterly incapable of such grand interstellar voyages, at","766":"least in reasonable transit times. But our computers can be taught the three-dimensionalpositions of all the nearby stars, and we can ask to be taken on a little trip - acircumnavigation of the collection of bright stars that constitute the Big Dipper, say - andwatch the constellations change. We connect the stars in typical constellations, in the usualcelestial follow-the-dots drawings. As we change our perspective, we see their apparentshapes distort severely. The inhabitants of the planets of distant stars witness quite differentconstellations in their night skies than we do in ours - other Rorschach tests for other minds.Perhaps sometime in the next few centuries a spaceship from Earth will actually travel suchdistances at some remarkable speed and see new constellations that no human has everviewed before - except with such a computer.","767":"The appearance of the constellations changes not only in space but also in time; notonly if we alter our position but also if we merely wait sufficiently long. Sometimes starsmove together in a group or cluster; other times a single star may move very rapidly withrespect to its fellows. Eventually such stars leave an old constellation and enter a new one.Occasionally, one member of a double-star system explodes, breaking the gravitationalshackles that bound its companion, which then leaps into space at its former orbital velocity,a slingshot in the sky. In addition, stars are born, stars evolve, and stars die. If we wait longenough, new stars appear and old stars vanish. The patterns in the sky slowly melt and alter.","768":"Even over the lifetime of the human species - a few million years - constellationshave been changing. Consider the present configuration of the Big Dipper, or Great Bear.Our computer can carry us in time as well as in space. As we run the Big Dipper backwardsinto the past, allowing for the motion of its stars, we find quite a different appearance amillion years ago. The Big Dipper then looked quite a bit like a spear. If a time machinedropped you precipitously in some unknown age in the distant past, you could in principledetermine the epoch by the configuration of the stars: If the Big Dipper is a spear, this mustbe the Middle Pleistocene.","769":"We can also ask the computer to run a constellation forward into time. Consider Leothe Lion. The zodiac is a band of twelve constellations seemingly wrapped around the skyin the apparent annual path of the Sun through the heavens. The root of the word is that forzoo, because the zodiacal constellations, like Leo, are mainly fancied to be animals. Amillion years from now, Leo will look still less like a lion than it does today. Perhaps ourremote descendants will call it the constellation of the radio telescope - although I suspect amillion years from now the radio telescope will have become more obsolete than the stonespear is now.","770":"The (nonzodiacal) constellation of Orion, the hunter, is outlined by four bright starsand bisected by a diagonal line of- three stars, which represent the belt of the hunter. Threedimmer stars hanging from the belt are, according to the conventional astronomicalprojective test, Orion\u2019s sword. The middle star in the sword is not actually a star but a greatcloud of gas called the Orion Nebula, in which stars are being born. Many of the stars inOrion are hot and young, evolving rapidly and ending their lives in colossal cosmicexplosions called supernovae. They are born and die in periods of tens of millions of years.If, on our computer, we were to run Orion rapidly into the far future, we would see astartling effect, the births and spectacular deaths of many of its stars, flashing on andwinking off like fireflies in the night.","771":"The solar neighborhood, the immediate environs of the Sun in space, includes thenearest star system, Alpha Centauri. It is really a triple system, two stars revolving aroundeach other, and a third, Proxima Centauri, orbiting the pair at a discreet distance. At somepositions in its orbit, Proxima is the closest known star to the Sun - hence its name. Moststars in the sky are members of double or multiple star systems. Our solitary Sun issomething of an anomaly.","772":"The second brightest star in the constellation Andromeda, called Beta Andromedae,is seventy-five light-years away. The light by which we see it now has spent seventy-fiveyears traversing the dark of interstellar space on its long journey to Earth. In the unlikelyevent that Beta Andromedae blew itself up last Tuesday, we would not know it for anotherseventy-five years, as this interesting information, traveling at the speed of light, wouldrequire seventy-five years to cross the enormous interstellar distances. When the light bywhich we now see this star set out on its long voyage, the young Albert Einstein, workingas a Swiss patent clerk, had just published his epochal special theory of relativity here onEarth.","773":"Space and time are interwoven. We cannot look out into space without looking backinto time. Light travels very fast. But space is very empty, and the stars are far apart.Distances of seventy-five light-years or less are very small compared to other distances inastronomy. From the Sun to the center of the Milky Way Galaxy is 30,000 light-years.","774":"From our galaxy to the nearest spiral galaxy, M31, also in the constellation Andromeda, is2,000,000 light-years. When the light we see today from M3 1 left for Earth, there were nohumans on our planet, although our ancestors were evolving rapidly to our present form.The distance from the Earth to the most remote quasars is eight or ten billion light-years.We see them today as they were before the Earth accumulated, before the Milky Way wasformed.","775":"This is not a situation restricted to astronomical objects, but only astronomicalobjects are so far away that the finite speed of light becomes important. If you are lookingat a friend three meters (ten feet) away, at the other end of the room, you are not seeing heras she is \u2018now\u2019; but rather as she \u2018was\u2019 a hundred millionth of a second ago. [(3 m) \/ (3 x10 m\/sec) = 1\/(10 \/sec) =10\" sec, or a hundredth of a microsecond. In this calculation wehave merely divided the distance by the speed to get the travel time.] But the differencebetween your friend \u2018now\u2019 and now minus a hundred-millionth of a second is too small tonotice. On the other hand, when we look at a quasar eight billion light-years away, the factthat we are seeing it as it was eight billion years ago may be very important. (For example,there are those who think that quasars are explosive events likely to happen only in theearly history of galaxies. In that case, the more distant the galaxy, the earlier in its historywe are observing it, and the more likely it is that we should see it as a quasar. Indeed, thenumber of quasars increases as we look to distances of more than about five billionlight-years).","776":"The two Voyager interstellar spacecraft, the fastest machines ever launched fromEarth, are now traveling at one ten-thousandth the speed of light. They would need 40,000years to go the distance to the nearest star.

What is magic about the speed of","777":"light? Might we someday be able to go faster than that?","778":"If you had walked through the pleasant Tuscan countryside in the 1890\u2019s, you mighthave come upon a somewhat long-haired teenage high school dropout on the road to Pavia.His teachers in Germany had told him that he would never amount to anything, that hisquestions destroyed classroom discipline, that he would be better off out of school. So heleft and wandered, delighting in the freedom of Northern Italy, where he could ruminate onmatters remote from the subjects he had been force-fed in his highly disciplined Prussianschoolroom. His name was Albert Einstein, and his ruminations changed the world.","779":"Einstein had been fascinated by Bernstein\u2019s People\u2019s Book of Natural Science, apopularization of science that described on its very first page the astonishing speed ofelectricity through wires and light through space. He wondered what the world would looklike if you could travel on a wave of light. To travel at the speed of light! What an engagingand magical thought for a boy on the road in a countryside dappled and rippling in sunlight.You could not tell you were on a light wave if you traveled with it. If you started on a wavecrest, you would stay on the crest and lose all notion of it being a wave. Something strangehappens at the speed of light. The more Einstein thought about such questions, the moretroubling they became. Paradoxes seemed to emerge everywhere if you could travel at thespeed of light. Certain ideas had been accepted as true without sufficiently careful thought.Einstein posed simple questions that could have been asked centuries earlier. For example,what do we mean when we say that two events are simultaneous?","780":"Imagine that I am riding a bicycle toward you. As I approach an intersection Inearly collide, so it seems to me, with a horse-drawn cart. I swerve and barely avoid beingrun over. Now think of the event again, and imagine that the cart and the bicycle are bothtraveling close to the speed of light. If you are standing down the road, the cart is travelingat right angles to your line of sight. You see me, by reflected sunlight, traveling toward you.Would not my speed be added to the speed of light, so that my image would get to youconsiderably before the image of the cart? Should you not see me swerve before you see thecart arrive? Can the cart and I approach the intersection simultaneously from my point ofview, but not from yours? Could I experience a near collision with the cart while youperhaps see me swerve around nothing and pedal cheerfully on toward the town of Vinci?These are curious and subtle questions. They challenge the obvious. There is a reason thatno one thought of them before Einstein. From such elementary questions, Einsteinproduced a fundamental rethinking of the world, a revolution in physics.","781":"If the world is to be understood, if we are to avoid such logical paradoxes whentraveling at high speeds, there are some rules, commandments of Nature, that must beobeyed. Einstein codified these rules in the special theory of relativity. Light (reflected oremitted) from an object travels at the same velocity whether the object is moving orstationary: Thou shall not add thy speed to the speed of light. Also, no material object maymove faster than light: Thou shalt not travel at or beyond the speed of light. Nothing inphysics prevents you from traveling as close to the speed of light as you like; 99.9 percentof the speed of light would be just fine. But no matter how hard you try, you can never gainthat last decimal point. For the world to be logically consistent, there must be a cosmicspeed limit. Otherwise, you could get to any speed you wanted by adding velocities on amoving platform.","782":"Europeans around the turn of the century generally believed in privileged frames ofreference: that German, or French, or British culture and political organization were betterthan those of other countries; that Europeans were superior to other peoples who werefortunate enough to be colonized. The social and political application of the ideas ofAristarchus and Copernicus was rejected or ignored. The young Einstein rebelled againstthe notion of privileged frames of reference in physics as much as he did in politics. In auniverse filled with stars rushing helter-skelter in all directions, there was no place that was\u2018at rest,\u2019 no framework from which to view the universe that was superior to any otherframework. This is what the word relativity means. The idea is very simple, despite itsmagical trappings: in viewing the universe, every place is as good as every other place. Thelaws of Nature must be identical no matter who is describing them. If this is to be true - andit would be stunning if there were something special about our insignificant location in theCosmos - then it follows that no one may travel faster than light.","783":"We hear the crack of a bullwhip because its tip is moving faster than the speed ofsound, creating a shock wave, a small sonic boom. A thunderclap has a similar origin. Itwas once thought that airplanes could not travel faster than sound. Today supersonic flightis commonplace. But the light barrier is different from the sound barrier. It is not merely anengineering problem like the one the supersonic airplane solves. It is a fundamental law ofNature, as basic as gravity. And there are no phenomena in our experience - like the crackof the bullwhips or the clap of thunder for sound - to suggest the possibility of traveling in avacuum faster than light. On the contrary, there is an extremely wide range of experience -with nuclear accelerators and atomic clocks, for example - in precise quantitativeagreement with special relativity.","784":"The problems of simultaneity do not apply to sound as they do to light becausesound is propagated through some material medium, usually air. The sound wave thatreaches you when a friend is talking is the motion of molecules in the air. Light, however,travels in a vacuum. There are restrictions on how molecules of air can move which do notapply to a vacuum. Light from the Sun reaches us across the intervening empty space, butno matter how carefully we listen, we do not hear the crackle of sunspots or the thunder ofthe solar flares. It was once thought, in the days before relativity, that light did propagatethrough a special medium that permeated all of space, called \u2018the luminiferous aether.\u2019 Butthe famous Michelson-Morley experiment demonstrated that such an aether does not exist.","785":"We sometimes hear of things that can travel faster than light. Something called \u2018thespeed of thought\u2019 is occasionally proffered. This is an exceptionally silly notion especiallysince the speed of impulses through the neurons in our brains is about the same as the speedof a donkey cart. That human beings have been clever enough to devise relativity showsthat we think well, but I do not think we can boast about thinking fast. The electricalimpulses in modern computers do, however, travel nearly at the speed of light.","786":"Special relativity, fully worked out by Einstein in his middle twenties, is supportedby every experiment performed to check it. Perhaps tomorrow someone will invent a theoryconsistent with everything else we know that circumvents paradoxes on such matters assimultaneity, avoids privileged reference frames and still permits travel faster than light.","787":"But I doubt it very much. Einstein\u2019s prohibition against traveling faster than light may clashwith our common sense. But on this question, why should we trust common sense? Why","788":"should our experience at 10 kilometers an hour constrain the laws of nature at 300,000kilometers per second? Relativity does set limits on what humans can ultimately do. But theuniverse is not required to be in perfect harmony with human ambition. Special relativityremoves from our grasp one way of reaching the stars, the ship that can go faster than light.Tantalizingly, it suggests another and quite unexpected method.","789":"Following George Gamow, let us imagine a place where the speed of light is not itstrue value of 300,000 kilometers per second, but something very modest: 40 kilometers perhour, say - and strictly enforced. (There are no penalties for breaking laws of Nature,because there are no crimes: Nature is self-regulating and merely arranges things so that itsprohibitions are impossible to transgress.) Imagine that you are approaching the speed oflight on a motor scooter. (Relativity is rich in sentences beginning \u2018Imagine . . .\u2019 Einsteincalled such an exercise a Gedankenexperiment, a thought experiment.) As your speedincreases, you begin to see around the corners of passing objects. While you are rigidlyfacing forward, things that are behind you appear within your forward field of vision. Closeto the speed of light, from your point of view, the world looks very odd - ultimatelyeverything is squeezed into a tiny circular window, which stays just ahead of you. From thestandpoint of a stationary observer, light reflected off you is reddened as you depart andblued as you return. If you travel toward the observer at almost the speed of light, you willbecome enveloped in an eerie chromatic radiance: your usually invisible infrared emissionwill be shifted to the shorter visible wavelengths. You become compressed in the directionof motion, your mass increases, and time, as you experience it, slows down, a breathtakingconsequence of traveling close to the speed of light called time dilation. But from thestandpoint of an observer moving with you - perhaps the scooter has a second seat - none ofthese effects occur.","790":"These peculiar and at first perplexing predictions of special relativity are true in thedeepest sense that anything in science is true. They depend on your relative motion. Butthey are real, not optical illusions. They can be demonstrated by simple mathematics,mainly first-year algebra and therefore understandable to any educated person. They arealso consistent with many experiments. Very accurate clocks carried in airplanes slowdown a little compared to stationary clocks. Nuclear accelerators are designed to allow forthe increase of mass with increasing speed; if they were not designed in this way,accelerated particles would all smash into the walls of the apparatus, and there would belittle to do in experimental nuclear physics. A speed is a distance divided by a time. Sincenear the velocity of light we cannot simply add speeds, as we are used to doing in theworkaday world, the familiar notions of absolute space and absolute time - independent ofyour relative motion - must give way. That is why you shrink. That is the reason for timedilation.","791":"Traveling close to the speed of light you would hardly age at all, but your friendsand your relatives back home would be aging at the usual rate. When you returned fromyour relativistic journey, what a difference there would be between your friends and you,they having aged decades, say, and you having aged hardly at all! Traveling close to thespeed of light is a kind of elixir of life. Because time slows down close to the speed of light,special relativity provides us with a means of going to the stars. But is it possible, in termsof practical engineering, to travel close to the speed of light? Is a starship feasible?","792":"Tuscany was not only the caldron of some of the thinking of the young AlbertEinstein; it was also the home of another great genius who lived 400 years earlier,","793":"Leonardo da Vinci, who delighted in climbing the Tuscan hills and viewing the groundfrom a great height, as if he were soaring like a bird. He drew the first aerial perspectives oflandscapes, towns and fortifications. Among Leonardo\u2019s many interests andaccomplishments - in painting, sculpture, anatomy, geology, natural history, military andcivil engineering - he had a great passion: to devise and fabricate a machine that could fly.He drew pictures, constructed models, built full-size prototypes and not one of themworked. No sufficiently powerful and lightweight engine then existed. The designs,however, were brilliant and encouraged the engineers of future times. Leonardo himselfwas depressed by these failures. But it was hardly his fault. He was trapped in the fifteenthcentury.","794":"A similar case occurred in 1939 when a group of engineers calling themselves theBritish Interplanetary Society designed a ship to take people to the Moon - using 1939technology. It was by no means identical to the design of the Apollo spacecraft, whichaccomplished exactly this mission three decades later, but it suggested that a mission to themoon might one day be a practical engineering possibility.","795":"Today we have preliminary designs for ships to take people to the stars. None ofthese spacecraft is imagined to leave the Earth directly. Rather, they are constructed inEarth orbit from where they are launched on their long interstellar journeys. One of themwas called Project Orion after the constellation, a reminder that the ship\u2019s ultimateobjective was the stars. Orion was designed to utilize explosions of hydrogen bombs,nuclear weapons, against an inertial plate, each explosion providing a kind of \u2018putt-putt,\u2019 avast nuclear motorboat in space. Orion seems entirely practical from an engineering pointof view. By its very nature it would have produced vast quantities of radioactive debris, butfor conscientious mission profiles only in the emptiness of interplanetary or interstellarspace. Orion was under serious development in the United States until the signing of theinternational treaty that forbids the detonation of nuclear weapons in space. This seems tome a great pity. The Orion starship is the best use of nuclear weapons I can think of.","796":"Project Daedalus is a recent design of the British Interplanetary Society. It assumesthe existence of a nuclear fusion reactor - something much safer as well as more efficientthan existing fission power plants. We do not have fusion reactors yet, but they areconfidently expected in the next few decades. Orion and Daedalus might travel at 10percent the speed of light. A trip to Alpha Centauri, 4.3 light-years away, would then takeforty-three years, less than a human lifetime. Such ships could not travel close enough tothe speed of light for special relativistic time dilation to become important. Even withoptimistic projections on the development of our technology, it does not seem likely thatOrion, Daedalus or their ilk will be built before the middle of the twenty-first century,although if we wished we could build Orion now.","797":"For voyages beyond the nearest stars, something else must be done. Perhaps Orionand Daedalus could be used as multigeneration ships, so those arriving at a planet ofanother star would be the remote descendants of those who had set out some centuriesbefore. Or perhaps a safe means of hibernation for humans will be found, so that the spacetravelers could be frozen and then reawakened centuries later. These nonrelativistic","798":"starships, enormously expensive as they would be, look relatively easy to design and buildand use compared to starships that travel close to the speed of light. Other star systems areaccessible to the human species, but only after great effort.","799":"Fast interstellar spaceflight - with the ship velocity approaching the speed of light -is an objective not for a hundred years but for a thousand or ten thousand. But it is inprinciple possible. A kind of interstellar ramjet has been proposed by R. W. Bussard whichscoops up the diffuse matter, mostly hydrogen atoms, that floats between the stars,accelerates it into a fusion engine and ejects it out the back. The hydrogen would be usedboth as fuel and as reaction mass. But in deep space there is only about one atom in everyten cubic centimeters, a volume the size of a grape. For the ramjet to work, it needs afrontal scoop hundreds of kilometers across. When the ship reaches relativistic velocities,the hydrogen atoms will be moving with respect to the spaceship at close to the speed oflight. If adequate precautions are not taken, the spaceship and its passengers will be fried bythese induced cosmic rays. One proposed solution uses a laser to strip the electrons off theinterstellar atoms and make them electrically charged while they are still some distanceaway, and an extremely strong magnetic field to deflect the charged atoms into the scoopand away from the rest of the spacecraft. This is engineering on a scale so farunprecedented on Earth. We are talking of engines the size of small worlds.","800":"But let us spend a moment thinking about such a ship. The Earth gravitationallyattracts us with a certain force, which if we are falling we experience as an acceleration.Were we to fall out of a tree - and many of our proto-human ancestors must have done so -we would plummet faster and faster, increasing our fall speed by ten meters (or thirty-twofeet) per second, every second. This acceleration, which characterizes the force of gravityholding us to the Earth\u2019s surface, is called 1 g, g for Earth gravity. We are comfortable withaccelerations of 1 g; we have grown up with 1 g. If we lived in an interstellar spacecraftthat could accelerate at 1 g, we would find ourselves in a perfectly natural environment. Infact, the equivalence between gravitational forces and the forces we would feel in anaccelerating spaceship is a major feature of Einstein\u2019s later general theory of relativity.","801":"With a continuous 1 g acceleration, after one year in space we would be traveling veryclose to the speed of light [(0.01 km\/sec 2 ) x (3 x 10 7 sec) = 3 x 10 5 km\/sec].","802":"Suppose that such a spacecraft accelerates at 1 g, approaching more and moreclosely to the speed of light until the midpoint of the journey; and then is turned around anddecelerates at 1 g until arriving at its destination. For most of the trip the velocity would bevery close to the speed of light and time would slow down enormously. A nearby missionobjective, a sun that may have planets, is Barnard\u2019s Star, about six light-years away. Itcould be reached in about eight years as measured by clocks aboard the ship; the center ofthe Milky Way, in twenty-one years; M31, the Andromeda galaxy, in twenty-eight years.","803":"Of course, people left behind on Earth would see things differently. Instead of twenty-oneyears to the center of the Galaxy, they would measure an elapsed time of 30,000 years.When we got home, few of our friends would be left to greet us. In principle, such ajourney, mounting the decimal points ever closer to the speed of light, would even permitus to circumnavigate the known universe in some fifty-six years ship time. We wouldreturn tens of billions of years in our future - to find the Earth a charred cinder and the Sundead. Relativistic spaceflight makes the universe accessible to advanced civilizations, but","804":"only to those who go on the journey. There seems to be no way for information to travelback to those left behind any faster than the speed of light.","805":"The designs for Orion, Daedalus and the Bussard Ramjet are probably farther fromthe actual interstellar spacecraft we will one day build than Leonardo\u2019s models are fromtoday\u2019s supersonic transports. But if we do not destroy ourselves, I believe that we will oneday venture to the stars. When our solar system is all explored, the planets of other starswill beckon.","806":"Space travel and time travel are connected. We can travel fast into space only bytraveling fast into the future. But what of the past? Could we return to the past and changeit? Could we make events turn out differently from what the history books assert? Wetravel slowly into the future all the time, at the rate of one day every day. With relativisticspaceflight we could travel fast into the future. But many physicists believe that a voyageinto the past is impossible. Even if you had a device that could travel backwards in time,they say, you would be unable to do anything that would make any difference. If youjourneyed into the past and prevented your parents from meeting, then you would neverhave been born - which is something of a contradiction, since you clearly exist. Like theproof of the irrationality of the square root of two, like the discussion of simultaneity inspecial relativity, this is an argument in which the premise is challenged because theconclusion seems absurd.","807":"But other physicists propose that two alternative histories, two equally validrealities, could exist side by side - the one you know and the one in which you were neverborn. Perhaps time itself has many potential dimensions, despite the fact that we arecondemned to experience only one of them. Suppose you could go back into the past andchange it - by persuading Queen Isabella not to support Christopher Columbus, for example.Then, it is argued, you would have set into motion a different sequence of historical events,which those you left behind in our time line would never know about. If that kind of timetravel were possible, then every imaginable alternative history might in some sense reallyexist.","808":"History consists for the most part of a complex bundle of deeply interwoven threads,social, cultural and economic forces that are not easily unraveled. The countless small,unpredictable and random events that flow on continually often have no long-rangeconsequences. But some, those occurring at critical junctures or branch points, may changethe pattern of history. There may be cases where profound changes can be made byrelatively trivial adjustments. The farther in the past such an event is, the more powerfulmay be its influence - because the longer the lever arm of time becomes.","809":"A polio virus is a tiny microorganmism. We encounter many of them every day. Butonly rarely, fortunately, does one of them infect one of us and cause this dread disease.Franklin D.

Becausethe disease was crippling, it may have provided Roosevelt with a greater compassion forthe underdog; or perhaps it improved his striving for success. If Roosevelt\u2019s personality hadbeen different, or if he had never had the ambition to be President of the United States, thegreat depression of the 1930\u2019s, World War II and the development of nuclear weaponsmight just possibly have turned out differently. The future of the world might have beenaltered. But a virus is an insignificant thing, only a millionth of a centimeter across. It is","810":"hardly anything at all.","811":"On the other hand, suppose our time traveler had persuaded Queen Isabella thatColumbus\u2019 geography was faulty, that from Eratosthenes\u2019 estimate of the circumference ofthe Earth, Columbus could never reach Asia. Almost certainly some other European wouldhave come along within a few decades and sailed west to the New World. Improvements innavigation, the lure of the spice trade and competition among rival European powers madethe discovery of America around 1500 more or less inevitable. Of course, there wouldtoday be no nation of Colombia, or District of Columbia or Columbus, Ohio, or ColumbiaUniversity in the Americas. But the overall course of history might have turned out more orless the same. In order to affect the future profoundly, a time traveler would probably haveto intervene in a number of carefully chosen events, to change the weave of history.","812":"It is a lovely fantasy, to explore those worlds that never were. By visiting them wecould truly understand how history works; history could become an experimental science.","813":"If an apparently pivotal person had never lived - Plato, say, or Paul, or Peter the Great -how different would the world be? What if the scientific tradition of the ancient IonianGreeks had survived and flourished? That would have required many of the social forces ofthe time to have been different - including the prevailing belief that slavery was natural andright. But what if that light that dawned in the eastern Mediterranean 2,500 years ago hadnot flickered out? What if science and the experimental method and the dignity of craftsand mechanical arts had been vigorously pursued 2,000 years before the IndustrialRevolution? What if the power of this new mode of thought had been more generallyappreciated? I sometimes think we might then have saved ten or twenty centuries. Perhapsthe contributions of Leonardo would have been made a thousand years ago and those ofAlbert Einstein five hundred years ago. In such an alternate Earth, Leonardo and Einsteinwould, of course, never have been born. Too many things would have been different. Inevery ejaculation there are hundreds of millions of sperm cells, only one of which canfertilize an egg and produce a member of the next generation of human beings. But whichsperm succeeds in fertilizing an egg must depend on the most minor and insignificant offactors, both internal and external.

Great fleets of interstellar transports would beunder construction in Earth orbit - unmanned survey ships, liners for immigrants, immensetrading ships to plow the seas of space. On all these ships there would be symbols andwriting. If we looked closely, we might see that the language was Greek. And perhaps thesymbol on the bow of one of the first starships would be a dodecahedron, with theinscription \u2018Starship Theodorus of the Planet Earth.\u2019","815":"In the time line of our world, things have gone somewhat more slowly.

In our immediate vicinity, there is not just one, but in a sense four: Jupiter,Saturn and Uranus each has a satellite system that, in the relative sizes and spacings of themoons, resembles closely the planets about the Sun. Extrapolation of the statistics of doublestars which are greatly disparate in mass suggests that almost all single stars like the Sunshould have planetary companions.","818":"We cannot yet directly see the planets of other stars, tiny points of light swamped inthe brilliance of their local suns. But we are becoming able to detect the gravitationalinfluence of an unseen planet on an observed star. Imagine such a star with a large \u2018propermotion,\u2019 moving over decades against the backdrop of more distant constellations; and witha large planet, the mass of Jupiter, say, whose orbital plane is by chance aligned at rightangles to our line of sight. When the dark planet is, from our perspective, to the right of thestar, the star will be pulled a little to the right, and conversely when the planet is to the left.Consequently, the path of the star will be altered, or perturbed, from a straight line to awavy one. The nearest star for which this gravitational perturbation method can be appliedis Barnard\u2019s Star, the nearest single star. The complex interactions of the three stars in theAlpha Centauri system would make the search for a low-mass companion there verydifficult. Even for Barnard\u2019s Star, the investigation must be painstaking, a search formicroscopic displacements of position on photographic plates exposed at the telescope overa period of decades. Two such quests have been performed for planets around Barnard\u2019sStar, and both have been by some criteria successful, implying the presence of two or moreplanets of Jovian mass moving in an orbit (calculated by Kepler\u2019s third law) somewhatcloser to their star than Jupiter and Saturn are to the Sun. But unfortunately the two sets ofobservations seem mutually incompatible. A planetary system around Barnard\u2019s Star maywell have been discovered, but an unambiguous demonstration awaits further study.","819":"Other methods of detecting planets around the stars are under development,including one where the obscuring light from the star is artificially occulted - with a disk infront of a space telescope, or by using the dark edge of the moon as such a disk - and thereflected light from the planet, no longer hidden by the brightness of the nearby star,emerges. In the next few decades we should have definitive answers to which of thehundred nearest stars have large planetary companions.","820":"In recent years, infrared observations have revealed a number of likely preplanetarydisk-shaped clouds of gas and dust around some of the nearby stars. Meanwhile, someprovocative theoretical studies have suggested that planetary systems are a galacticcommonplace. A set of computer investigations has examined the evolution of a flat,condensing disk of gas and dust of the sort that is thought to lead to stars and planets. Smalllumps of matter - the first condensations in the disk - are injected at random times into thecloud. The lumps accrete dust particles as they move. When they become sizable, they alsogravitationally attract gas, mainly hydrogen, in the cloud. When two moving lumps collide,the computer program makes them stick. The process continues until all the gas and dusthas been in this way used up. The results depend on the initial conditions, particularly onthe distribution of gas and dust density with distance from the center of the cloud. But for arange of plausible initial conditions, planetary systems - about ten planets, terrestrials close","821":"to the star, Jovians on the exterior - recognizably like ours are generated. Under othercircumstances, there are no planets - just a smattering of asteroids; or there may be Jovianplanets near the star; or a Jovian planet may accrete so much gas and dust as to become astar, the origin of a binary star system. It is still too early to be sure, but it seems that asplendid variety of planetary systems is to be found throughout the Galaxy, and with highfrequency - all stars must come, we think, from such clouds of gas and dust. There may bea hundred billion planetary systems in the Galaxy awaiting exploration.","822":"Not one of those worlds will be identical to Earth. A few will be hospitable; mostwill appear hostile. Many will be achingly beautiful. In some worlds there will be manysuns in the daytime sky, many moons in the heavens at night, or great particle ring systemssoaring from horizon to horizon. Some moons will be so close that their planet will loomhigh in the heavens, covering half the sky. And some worlds will look out onto a vastgaseous nebula, the remains of an ordinary star that once was and is no longer. In all thoseskies, rich in distant and exotic constellations, there will be a faint yellow star - perhapsbarely seen by the naked eye, perhaps visible only through the telescope - the home star ofthe fleet of interstellar transports exploring this tiny region of the great Milky Way Galaxy.","823":"The themes of space and time are, as we have seen, intertwined. Worlds and stars,like people, are born, live and die. The lifetime of a human being is measured in decades;the lifetime of the Sun is a hundred million times longer. Compared to a star, we are likemayflies, fleeting ephemeral creatures who live out their whole lives in the course of asingle day. From the point of view of a mayfly, human beings are stolid, boring, almostentirely immovable, offering hardly a hint that they ever do anything. From the point ofview of a star, a human being is a tiny flash, one of billions of brief lives flickeringtenuously on the surface of a strangely cold, anomalously solid, exotically remote sphere ofsilicate and iron.","824":"In all those other worlds in space there are events in progress, occurrences that willdetermine their futures. And on our small planet, this moment in history is a historicalbranch point as profound as the confrontation of the Ionian scientists with the mystics 2,500years ago.

Except for hydrogen, they are all made in stars. A star is a kind of cosmickitchen inside which atoms of hydrogen are cooked into heavier atoms. Stars condensefrom interstellar gas and dust, which are composed mostly of hydrogen. But the hydrogenwas made in the Big Bang, the explosion that began the Cosmos.

But the nucleusis a hundred thousand times smaller still, which is part of the reason it took so long to bediscovered.* Nevertheless, most of the mass of an atom is in its nucleus; the electrons areby comparison just clouds of moving fluff. Atoms are mainly empty space. Matter iscomposed chiefly of nothing.","838":"* It had previously been thought that the protons were uniformly distributed throughout the electroncloud, rather than being concentrated in a nucleus of positive charge at the center.

But negative charges repel eachother. My elbow does not slither through the table because atoms have electrons aroundtheir nuclei and because electrical forces are strong. Everyday life depends on the structureof the atom. Turn off the electrical charges and everything crumbles to an invisible finedust. Without electrical forces, there would no longer be things in the universe - merelydiffuse clouds of electrons, protons and neutrons, and gravitating spheres of elementaryparticles, the featureless remnants of worlds.","841":"When we consider cutting an apple pie, continuing down beyond a single atom, weconfront an infinity of the very small.

If you stand between two mirrors - in a barber shop, say - you seea large number of images of yourself, each the reflection of another. You cannot see aninfinity of images because the mirrors are not perfectly flat and aligned, because light doesnot travel infinitely fast, and because you are in the way.

A googolplex is precisely as far from infinity as is thenumber one. We could try to write out a googolplex, but it is a forlorn ambition.

Are quarks the ultimate constituents of matter,or are they too composed of still smaller and more elementary particles? Will we ever cometo an end in our understanding of the nature of matter, or is there an infinite regression intomore and more fundamental particles? This is one of the great unsolved problems inscience.","851":"The transmutation of the elements was pursued in medieval laboratories in a questcalled alchemy. Many alchemists believed that all matter was a mixture of four elementarysubstances: water, air, earth and fire, an ancient Ionian speculation. By altering the relative","852":"proportions of earth and fire, say, you would be able, they thought, to change copper intogold. The field swarmed with charming frauds and con men, such as Cagliostro and theCount of Saint-Germain, who pretended not only to transmute the elements but also to holdthe secret of immortality. Sometimes gold was hidden in a wand with a false bottom, toappear miraculously in a crucible at the end of some arduous experimental demonstration.With wealth and immortality the bait, the European nobility found itself transferring largesums to the practitioners of this dubious art. But there were more serious alchemists such asParacelsus and even Isaac Newton. The money was not altogether wasted - new chemicalelements, such as phosphorous, antimony and mercury, were discovered. In fact, the originof modern chemistry can be traced directly to these experiments.","853":"There are ninety-two chemically distinct kinds of naturally occurring atoms. Theyare called the chemical elements and until recently constituted everything on our planet,although they are mainly found combined into molecules. Water is a molecule made ofhydrogen and oxygen atoms. Air is made mostly of the atoms nitrogen (N), oxygen (O),carbon (C), hydrogen (H) and argon (Ar), in the molecular forms N 2 , O 2 , CO 2 , PEO and Ar.The Earth itself is a very rich mixture of atoms, mostly silicon,* oxygen, aluminum,magnesium and iron. Fire is not made of chemical elements at all. It is a radiating plasma inwhich the high temperature has stripped some of the electrons from their nuclei. Not one ofthe four ancient Ionian and alchemical \u2018elements\u2019 is in the modern sense an element at all:one is a molecule, two are mixtures of molecules, and the last is a plasma.","854":"* Silicon is an atom. Silicone is a molecule, one of billions of different varieties containing silicon.Silicon and silicone have different properties and applications.","855":"Since the time of the alchemists, more and more elements have been discovered, thelatest to be found tending to be the rarest. Many are familiar - those that primarily make upthe Earth; or those fundamental to life. Some are solids, some gases, and two (bromine andmercury) are liquids at room temperature. Scientists conventionally arrange them in orderof complexity. The simplest, hydrogen, is element 1 ; the most complex, uranium is element92. Other elements are less familiar - hafnium, erbium, dysprosium and praseodymium, say,which we do not much bump into in everyday life. By and large, the more familiar anelement is, the more abundant it is. The Earth contains a great deal of iron and rather littleyttrium. There are, of course, exceptions to this rule, such as gold or uranium, elementsprized because of arbitrary economic conventions or aesthetic judgments, or because theyhave remarkable practical applications.","856":"The fact that atoms are composed of three kinds of elementary particles - protons,neutrons and electrons is a comparatively recent finding. The neutron was not discovereduntil 1932. Modern physics and chemistry have reduced the complexity of the sensibleworld to an astonishing simplicity: three units put together in various patterns make,essentially, everything.","857":"The neutrons, as we have said and as their name suggests, carry no electrical charge.The protons have a positive charge and the electrons an equal negative charge. Theattraction between the unlike charges of electrons and protons is what holds the atomtogether. Since each atom is electrically neutral, the number of protons in the nucleus must","858":"exactly equal the number of electrons in the electron cloud. The chemistry of an atomdepends only on the number of electrons, which equals the number of protons, and which iscalled the atomic number. Chemistry is simply numbers, an idea Pythagoras would haveliked. If you are an atom with one proton, you are hydrogen; two, helium; three, lithium;four, beryllium; five, boron; six, carbon; seven, nitrogen; eight, oxygen; and so on, up to 92protons, in which case your name is uranium.","859":"Like charges, charges of the same sign, strongly repel one another. We can think ofit as a dedicated mutual aversion to their own kind, a little as if the world were denselypopulated by anchorites and misanthropes. Electrons repel electrons. Protons repel protons.So how can a nucleus stick together? Why does it not instantly fly apart? Because there isanother force of nature: not gravity, not electricity, but the short-range nuclear force, which,like a set of hooks that engage only when protons and neutrons come very close together,thereby overcomes the electrical repulsion among the protons. The neutrons, whichcontribute nuclear forces of attraction and no electrical forces of repulsion, provide a kindof glue that helps to hold the nucleus together. Longing for solitude, the hermits have beenchained to their grumpy fellows and set among others given to indiscriminate and volubleamiability.","860":"Two protons and two neutrons are the nucleus of a helium atom, which turns out tobe very stable. Three helium nuclei make a carbon nucleus; four, oxygen; five, neon; six,magnesium; seven, silicon; eight, sulfur; and so on. Every time we add one or more protonsand enough neutrons to keep the nucleus together, we make a new chemical element. If wesubtract one proton and three neutrons from mercury, we make gold, the dream of theancient alchemists. Beyond uranium there are other elements that do not naturally occur onEarth. They are synthesized by human beings and in most cases promptly fall to pieces.","861":"One of them, Element 94, is called plutonium and is one of the most toxic substancesknown. Unfortunately, it falls to pieces rather slowly.","862":"Where do the naturally occurring elements come from? We might contemplate aseparate creation of each atomic species. But the universe, all of it, almost everywhere, is99 percent hydrogen and helium,* the two simplest elements. Helium, in fact, was detectedon the Sun before it was found on the Earth - hence its name (from Helios, one of the Greeksun gods). Might the other chemical elements have somehow evolved from hydrogen andhelium? To balance the electrical repulsion, pieces of nuclear matter would have to bebrought very close together so that the short-range nuclear forces are engaged. This canhappen only at very high temperatures where the particles are moving so fast that therepulsive force does not have time to act - temperatures of tens of millions of degrees. Innature, such high temperatures and attendant high pressures are common only in the insidesof the stars.","863":"* The Earth is an exception, because our primordial hydrogen, only weakly bound by our planet\u2019scomparatively feeble gravitational attraction, has by now largely escaped to space. Jupiter, with its moremassive gravity, has retained at least much of its original complement of the lightest element.","864":"We have examined our Sun, the nearest star, in various wavelengths from radiowaves to ordinary visible light to X-rays, all of which arise only from its outermost layers.","865":"It is not exactly a red-hot stone, as Anaxagoras thought, but rather a great ball of hydrogenand helium gas, glowing because of its high temperatures, in the same way that a pokerglows when it is brought to red heat. Anaxagoras was at least partly right. Violent solarstorms produce brilliant flares that disrupt radio communications on Earth; and immensearching plumes of hot gas, guided by the Sun\u2019s magnetic field, the solar prominences,which dwarf the Earth. The sunspots, sometimes visible to the naked eye at sunset, arecooler regions of enhanced magnetic field strength. All this incessant, roiling, turbulentactivity is in the comparatively cool visible surface. We see only to temperatures of about6,000 degrees. But the hidden interior of the Sun, where sunlight is being generated, is at40 million degrees.","866":"Stars and their accompanying planets are born in the gravitational collapse of acloud of interstellar gas and dust. The collision of the gas molecules in the interior of thecloud heats it, eventually to the point where hydrogen begins to fuse into helium: fourhydrogen nuclei combine to form a helium nucleus, with an attendant release of agamma-ray photon. Suffering alternate absorption and emission by the overlying matter,gradually working its way toward the surface of the star, losing energy at every step, thephoton\u2019s epic journey takes a million years until, as visible light, it reaches the surface andis radiated to space. The star has turned on. The gravitational collapse of the prestellarcloud has been halted. The weight of the outer layers of the star is now supported by thehigh temperatures and pressures generated in the interior nuclear reactions. The Sun hasbeen in such a stable situation for the past five billion years. Thermonuclear reactions likethose in a hydrogen bomb are powering the Sun in a contained and continuous explosion,converting some four hundred million tons (4 x 10 14 grams) of hydrogen into helium everysecond. When we look up at night and view the stars, everything we see is shining becauseof distant nuclear fusion.","867":"In the direction of the star Deneb, in the constellation of Cygnus the Swan, is anenormous glowing superbubble of extremely hot gas, probably produced by supernovaexplosions, the deaths of stars, near the center of the bubble. At the periphery, interstellarmatter is compressed by the supernova shock wave, triggering new generations of cloudcollapse and star formation. In this sense, stars have parents; and, as is sometimes also truefor humans, a parent may die in the birth of the child.","868":"Stars like the Sun are born in batches, in great compressed cloud complexes such asthe Orion Nebula. Seen from the outside, such clouds seem dark and gloomy. But inside,they are brilliantly illuminated by the hot newborn stars. Later, the stars wander out of theirnursery to seek their fortunes in the Milky Way, stellar adolescents still surrounded by tuftsof glowing nebulosity, residues still gravitationally attached of their amniotic gas. ThePleiades are a nearby example. As in the families of humans, the maturing stars journey farfrom home, and the siblings see little of each other. Somewhere in the Galaxy there arestars - perhaps dozens of them - that are the brothers and sisters of the Sun, formed from thesame cloud complex, some 5 billion years ago. But we do not know which stars they are.They may, for all we know, be on the other side of the Milky Way.","869":"The conversion of hydrogen into helium in the center of the Sun not only accountsfor the Sun\u2019s brightness in photons of visible light; it also produces a radiance of a moremysterious and ghostly kind: The Sun glows faintly in neutrinos, which, like photons,","870":"weigh nothing and travel at the speed of light. But neutrinos are not photons. They are not akind of light. Neutrinos, like protons, electrons and neutrons, carry an intrinsic angularmomentum, or spin, while photons have no spin at all. Matter is transparent to neutrinos,which pass almost effortlessly through the Earth and through the Sun. Only a tiny fractionof them is stopped by the intervening matter. As I look up at the Sun for a second, a billionneutrinos pass through my eyeball. Of course, they are not stopped at the retina as ordinaryphotons are but continue unmolested through the back of my head. The curious part is thatif at night I look down at the ground, toward the place where the Sun would be (if the Earthwere not in the way), almost exactly the same number of solar neutrinos pass through myeyeball, pouring through an interposed Earth which is as transparent to neutrinos as a paneof clear glass is to visible light.","871":"If our knowledge of the solar interior is as complete as we think, and if we alsounderstand the nuclear physics that makes neutrinos, then we should be able to calculatewith fair accuracy how many solar neutrinos we should receive in a given area - such as myeyeball - in a given unit of time, such as a second. Experimental confirmation of thecalculation is much more difficult. Since neutrinos pass directly through the Earth, wecannot catch a given one. But for a vast number of neutrinos, a small fraction will interactwith matter and in the appropriate circumstances might be detected. Neutrinos can on rareoccasion convert chlorine atoms into argon atoms, with the same total number of protonsand neutrons. To detect the predicted solar neutrino flux, you need an immense amount ofchlorine, so American physicists have poured a huge quantity of cleaning fluid into theHomestake Mine in Lead, South Dakota. The chlorine is microchemically swept for thenewly produced argon. The more argon found, the more neutrinos inferred. Theseexperiments imply that the Sun is dimmer in neutrinos than the calculations predict.","872":"There is a real and unsolved mystery here. The low solar neutrino flux probablydoes not put our view of stellar nucleosynthesis in jeopardy, but it surely means somethingimportant. Proposed explanations range from the hypothesis that neutrinos fall to piecesduring their passage between the Sun and the Earth to the idea that the nuclear fires in thesolar interior are temporarily banked, sunlight being generated in our time partly by slowgravitational contraction. But neutrino astronomy is very new. For the moment we standamazed at having created a tool that can peer directly into the blazing heart of the Sun. Asthe sensitivity of the neutrino telescope improves, it may become possible to probe nuclearfusion in the deep interiors of the nearby stars.","873":"But hydrogen fusion cannot continue forever: in the Sun or any other star, there isonly so much hydrogen fuel in its hot interior. The fate of a star, the end of its life cycle,depends very much on its initial mass. If, after whatever matter it has lost to space, a starretains two or three times the mass of the Sun, it ends its life cycle in a startlingly differentmode than the Sun. But the Sun\u2019s fate is spectacular enough. When the central hydrogenhas all reacted to form helium, five or six billion years from now, the zone of hydrogenfusion will slowly migrate outward, an expanding shell of thermonuclear reactions, until itreaches the place where the temperatures are less than about ten million degrees. Thenhydrogen fusion will shut itself off. Meanwhile the self-gravity of the Sun will force arenewed contraction of its helium-rich core and a further increase in its interiortemperatures and pressures. The helium nuclei will be jammed together still more tightly,","874":"so much so that they begin to stick together, the hooks of their short-range nuclear forcesbecoming engaged despite the mutual electrical repulsion. The ash will become fuel, andthe Sun will be triggered into a second round of fusion reactions.","875":"This process will generate the elements carbon and oxygen and provide additionalenergy for the Sun to continue shining for a limited time. A star is a phoenix, destined torise for a time from its own ashes.* Under the combined influence of hydrogen fusion in athin shell far from the solar interior and the high temperature helium fusion in the core, theSun will undergo a major change: its exterior will expand and cool. The Sun will become ared giant star, its visible surface so far from its interior that the gravity at its surface growsfeeble, its atmosphere expanding into space in a kind of stellar gale. When the Sun, ruddyand bloated, becomes a red giant, it will envelop and devour the planets Mercury andVenus - and probably the Earth as well. The inner solar system will then reside within theSun.","876":"* Stars more massive than the Sun achieve higher central temperatures and pressures in their lateevolutionary stages. They are able to rise more than once from their ashes, using carbon and oxygen as fuelfor synthesizing still heavier elements.","877":"Billions of years from now, there will be a last perfect day on Earth. Thereafter theSun will slowly become red and distended, presiding over an Earth sweltering even at thepoles. The Arctic and Antarctic icecaps will melt, flooding the coasts of the world.

Eventually the oceans will boil, the atmosphere will evaporate away to spaceand a catastrophe of the most immense proportions imaginable will overtake our planet.* Inthe meantime, human beings will almost certainly have evolved into something quitedifferent. Perhaps our descendants will be able to control or moderate stellar evolution. Orperhaps they will merely pick up and leave for Mars or Europa or Titan or, at last, asRobert Goddard envisioned, seek out an uninhabited planet in some young and promisingplanetary system.","878":"* The Aztecs foretold a time \u2018when the Earth has become tired. . ., when the seed of Earth hasended.\u2019 On that day, they believed, the Sun will fall from the sky and the stars will be shaken from theheavens.","879":"The Sun\u2019s stellar ash can be reused for fuel only up to a point. Eventually the timewill come when the solar interior is all carbon and oxygen, when at the prevailingtemperatures and pressures no further nuclear reactions can occur. After the central heliumis almost all used up, the interior of the Sun will continue its postponed collapse, thetemperatures will rise again, triggering a last round of nuclear reactions and expanding thesolar atmosphere a little. In its death throes, the Sun will slowly pulsate, expanding andcontracting once every few millennia, eventually spewing its atmosphere into space in oneor more concentric shells of gas. The hot exposed solar interior will flood the shell withultraviolet light, inducing a lovely red and blue fluorescence extending beyond the orbit of","880":"Pluto. Perhaps half the mass of the Sun will be lost in this way.

(They have nothing todo with planets, but some of them seemed reminiscent in inferior telescopes of theblue-green discs of Uranus and Neptune.) They appear as rings, but only because, as withsoap bubbles, we see more of them at the periphery than at the center. Every planetarynebula is a token of a star in extremis. Near the central star there may be a retinue of deadworlds, the remnants of planets once full of life and now airless and ocean-free, bathed in awraithlike luminance. The remains of the Sun, the exposed solar core at first enveloped inits planetary nebula, will be a small hot star, cooling to space, collapsed to a densityunheard of on Earth, more than a ton per teaspoonful. Billions of years hence, the Sun willbecome a degenerate white dwarf, cooling like all those points of light we see at the centersof planetary nebulae from high surface temperatures to its ultimate state, a dark and deadblack dwarf.","882":"Two stars of roughly the same mass will evolve roughly in parallel. But a moremassive star will spend its nuclear fuel faster, become a red giant sooner, and be first toenter the final white dwarf decline. There should therefore be, as there are, many cases ofbinary stars, one component a red giant, the other a white dwarf. Some such pairs are soclose together that they touch, and the glowing stellar atmosphere flows from the distendedred giant to the compact white dwarf, tending to fall on a particular province of the surfaceof the white dwarf. The hydrogen accumulates, compressed to higher and higher pressuresand temperatures by the intense gravity of the white dwarf, until the stolen atmosphere ofthe red giant undergoes thermonuclear reactions, and the white dwarf briefly flares intobrilliance. Such a binary is called a nova and has quite a different origin from a supernova.Novae occur only in binary systems and are powered by hydrogen fusion; supernovae occurin single stars and are powered by silicon fusion.","883":"Atoms synthesized in the interiors of stars are commonly returned to the interstellargas. Red giants find their outer atmospheres blowing away into space; planetary nebulaeare the final stages of Sunlike stars blowing their tops. Supernovae violently eject much oftheir stellar mass into space. The atoms returned are, naturally, those most readily made inthe thermonuclear reactions in stellar interiors: Hydrogen fuses into helium, helium intocarbon, carbon into oxygen and thereafter, in massive stars, by the successive addition offurther helium nuclei, neon, magnesium, silicon, sulfur, and so on are built additions bystages, two protons and two neutrons per stage, all the way to iron. Direct fusion of siliconalso generates iron, a pair of silicon atoms, each with twenty-eight protons and neutrons,joining, at a temperature of billions of degrees, to make an atom of iron with fifty-sixprotons and neutrons.","884":"These are all familiar chemical elements. We recognize their names. Such stellarnuclear reactions do not readily generate erbium, hafnium, dysprosium, praseodymium oryttrium, but rather the elements we know in everyday life, elements returned to theinterstellar gas, where they are swept up in a subsequent generation of cloud collapse andstar and planet formation. All the elements of the Earth except hydrogen and some heliumhave been cooked by a kind of stellar alchemy billions of years ago in stars, some of which","885":"are today inconspicuous white dwarfs on the other side of the Milky Way Galaxy. Thenitrogen in our DNA, the calcium in our teeth, the iron in our blood, the carbon in our applepies were made in the interiors of collapsing stars. We are made of starstuff.","886":"Some of the rarer elements are generated in the supernova explosion itself. We haverelatively abundant gold and uranium on Earth only because many supernova explosionshad occurred just before the solar system formed. Other planetary systems may havesomewhat different amounts of our rare elements. Are there planets where the inhabitantsproudly display pendants of niobium and bracelets of protactinium, while gold is alaboratory curiosity? Would our lives be improved if gold and uranium were as obscure andunimportant on Earth as praseodymium?","887":"The origin and evolution of life are connected in the most intimate way with theorigin and evolution of the stars. First: The very matter of which we are composed, theatoms that make life possible, were generated long ago and far away in giant red stars. Therelative abundance of the chemical elements found in the Cosmos matches the relativeabundance of atoms generated in stars so well as to leave little doubt that red giants andsupernovae are the ovens and crucibles in which matter has been forged. The Sun is asecond- or third-generation star. All the matter in it, all the matter you see around you, hasbeen through one or two previous cycles of stellar alchemy. Second: The existence ofcertain varieties of heavy atoms on the Earth suggests that there was a nearby supernovaexplosion shortly before the solar system was formed. But this is unlikely to be a merecoincidence; more likely, the shock wave produced by the supernova compressedinterstellar gas and dust and triggered the condensation of the solar system. Third: Whenthe Sun turned on, its ultraviolet radiation poured into the atmosphere of the Earth; itswarmth generated lightning; and these energy sources sparked the complex organicmolecules that led to the origin of life. Fourth: Life on Earth runs almost exclusively onsunlight. Plants gather the photons and convert solar to chemical energy. Animals parasitizethe plants. Farming is simply the methodical harvesting of sunlight, using plants asgrudging intermediaries. We are, almost all of us, solar-powered. Finally, the hereditarychanges called mutations provide the raw material for evolution. Mutations, from whichnature selects its new inventory of life forms, are produced in part by cosmic rays -high-energy particles ejected almost at the speed of light in supernova explosions. Theevolution of life on Earth is driven in part by the spectacular deaths of distant, massivesuns.","888":"Imagine carrying a Geiger counter and a piece of uranium ore to some place deepbeneath the Earth - a gold mine, say, or a lava tube, a cave carved through the Earth by ariver of molten rock. The sensitive counter clicks when exposed to gamma rays or to suchhigh-energy charged particles as protons and helium nuclei. If we bring it close to theuranium ore, which is emitting helium nuclei in a spontaneous, nuclear decay, the countrate, the number of clicks per minute, increases dramatically. If we drop the uranium oreinto a heavy lead canister, the count rate declines substantially; the lead has absorbed theuranium radiation. But some clicks can still be heard. Of the remaining counts, a fractioncome from natural radioactivity in the walls of the cave. But there are more clicks than canbe accounted for by radioactivity. Some of them are caused by high-energy chargedparticles penetrating the roof. We are listening to cosmic rays, produced in another age in","889":"the depths of space. Cosmic rays, mainly electrons and protons, have bombarded the Earthfor the entire history of life on our planet. A star destroys itself thousands of light-yearsaway and produces cosmic rays that spiral through the Milky Way Galaxy for millions ofyears until, quite by accident, some of them strike the Earth, and our hereditary material.Perhaps some key steps in the development of the genetic code, or the Cambrian explosion,or bipedal stature among our ancestors were initiated by cosmic rays.","890":"On July 4, in the year 1054, Chinese astronomers recorded what they called a \u2018gueststar\u2019 in the constellation of Taurus, the Bull. A star never before seen became brighter thanany star in the sky. Halfway around the world, in the American Southwest, there was then ahigh culture, rich in astronomical tradition, that also witnessed this brilliant new star.*","891":"From carbon 14 dating of the remains of a charcoal fire, we know that in the middleeleventh century some Anasazi, the antecedents of the Hopi of today, were living under anoverhanging ledge in what is today New Mexico.

There is also a handprint, perhapsthe artist\u2019s signature.","892":"* Moslem observers noted it as well. But there is not a word about it in all the chronicles of Europe.","893":"This remarkable star, 5,000 light-years distant, is now called the Crab Supernova,because an astronomer centuries later was unaccountably reminded of a crab when lookingat the explosion remnant through his telescope. The Crab Nebula is the remains of amassive star that blew itself up. The explosion was seen on Earth with the naked eye forthree months. Easily visible in broad daylight, you could read by it at night. On the average,a supernova occurs in a given galaxy about once every century. During the lifetime of atypical galaxy, about ten billion years, a hundred million stars will have exploded - a greatmany, but still only about one star in a thousand. In the Milky Way, after the event of 1054,there was a supernova observed in 1572, and described by Tycho Brahe, and another, justafter, in 1604, described by Johannes Kepler.* Unhappily, no supernova explosions havebeen observed in our Galaxy since the invention of the telescope, and astronomers havebeen chafing at the bit for some centuries.","894":"* Kepler published in 1606 a book called De Stella Nova, \u2018On the New Star,\u2019 in which he wonders ifa supernova is the result of some random concatenation of atoms in the heavens, ffe presents what he says is","895":". . not my own opinion, but my wife\u2019s: Yesterday, when weary with writing, I was called to supper, and asalad I had asked for was set before me. \u201cIt seems then,\u201d I said, \u201cif pewter dishes, leaves of lettuce, grains ofsalt, drops of water, vinegar, oil and slices of eggs had been flying about in the air for all eternity, it might atlast happen by chance that there would come a salad.\u201d \u201cYes,\u201d responded my lovely, \u201cbut not so nice as thisone of mine.\u201d \u2019","896":"Supernovae are now routinely observed in other galaxies. Among my candidates forthe sentence that would most thoroughly astonish an astronomer of the early 1900\u2019s is thefollowing, from a paper by David Helfand and Knox Long in the December 6, 1979, issueof the British journal Nature : \u2018On 5 March, 1979, an extremely intense burst of hard x-raysand gamma rays was recorded by the nine interplanetary spacecraft of the burst sensor","897":"network, and localized by time-of-flight determinations to a position coincident with thesupernova remnant N49 in the Large Magellanic Cloud.\u2019 (The Large Magellanic Cloud,so-called because the first inhabitant of the Northern Hemisphere to notice it was Magellan,is a small satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, 180,000 light-years distant. There is also, asyou might expect, a Small Magellanic Cloud.) However, in the same issue of Nature, E. P.Mazets and colleagues of the Ioffe Institute, Leningrad - who observed this source with thegamma-ray burst detector aboard the Venera 1 1 and 12 spacecraft on their way to land onVenus - argue that what is being seen is a flaring pulsar only a few hundred light-yearsaway. But despite the close agreement in position Helfand and Long do not insist that thegamma-ray outburst is associated with the supernova remnant. They charitably considermany alternatives, including the surprising possibility that the source lies within the solarsystem. Perhaps it is the exhaust of an alien starship on its long voyage home. But a rousingof the stellar fires in N49 is a simpler hypothesis: we are sure there are such things assupernovae.","898":"The fate of the inner solar system as the Sun becomes a red giant is grim enough.But at least the planets will never be melted and frizzled by an erupting supernova. That isa fate reserved for planets near stars more massive than the Sun. Since such stars withhigher temperatures and pressures run rapidly through their store of nuclear fuel, theirlifetimes are much shorter than the Sun\u2019s. A star tens of times more massive than the Suncan stably convert hydrogen to helium for only a few million years before moving brieflyon to more exotic nuclear reactions. Thus there is almost certainly not enough time for theevolution of advanced forms of life on any accompanying planets; and it will be rare thatbeings elsewhere can ever know that their star will become a supernova: if they live longenough to understand supernovae, their star is unlikely to become one.","899":"The essential preliminary to a supernova explosion is the generation by siliconfusion of a massive iron core. Under enormous pressure, the free electrons in the stellarinterior are forceably melded with the protons of the iron nuclei, the equal and oppositeelectrical charges canceling each other out; the inside of the star is turned into a single giantatomic nucleus, occupying a much smaller volume than the precursor electrons and ironnuclei. The core implodes violently, the exterior rebounds and a supernova explosionresults. A supernova can be brighter than the combined radiance of all the other stars in thegalaxy within which it is embedded. All those recently hatched massive blue-whitesupergiant stars in Orion are destined in the next few million years to become supernovae, acontinuing cosmic fireworks in the constellation of the hunter.","900":"The awesome supernova explosion ejects into space most of the matter of theprecursor star - a little residual hydrogen and helium and significant amounts of otheratoms, carbon and silicon, iron and uranium. Remaining is a core of hot neutrons, boundtogether by nuclear forces, a single, massive atomic nucleus with an atomic weight about10 56 , a sun thirty kilometers across; a tiny, shrunken, dense, withered stellar fragment, arapidly rotating neutron star. As the core of a massive red giant collapses to form such aneutron star, it spins faster. The neutron star at the center of the Crab Nebula is an immenseatomic nucleus, about the size of Manhattan, spinning thirty times a second. Its powerfulmagnetic field, amplified during the collapse, traps charged particles rather as the muchtinier magnetic field of Jupiter does. Electrons in the rotating magnetic field emit beamed","901":"radiation not only at radio frequencies but in visible light as well. If the Earth happens to liein the beam of this cosmic lighthouse, we see it flash once each rotation. This is the reasonit is called a pulsar. Blinking and ticking like a cosmic metronome, pulsars keep far bettertime than the most accurate ordinary clock. Long-term timing of the radio pulse rate ofsome pulsars, for instance, one called PSR 0329+54, suggests that these objects may haveone or more small planetary companions. It is perhaps conceivable that a planet couldsurvive the evolution of a star into a pulsar; or a planet could be captured at a later time. Iwonder how the sky would look from the surface of such a planet.","902":"Neutron star matter weighs -about the same as an ordinary mountain perteaspoonful - so much that if you had a piece of it and let it go (you could hardly dootherwise), it might pass effortlessly through the Earth like a falling stone through air,carving a hole for itself completely through our planet and emerging out the other side -perhaps in China. People there might be out for a stroll, minding their own business, whena tiny lump of neutron star plummets out of the ground, hovers for a moment, and thenreturns beneath the Earth, providing at least a diversion from the routine of the day. If apiece of neutron star matter were dropped from nearby space, with the Earth rotatingbeneath it as it fell, it would plunge repeatedly through the rotating Earth, punchinghundreds of thousands of holes before friction with the interior of our planet stopped themotion. Before it comes to rest at the center of the Earth, the inside of our planet mightlook briefly like a Swiss cheese until the subterranean flow of rock and metal healed thewounds. It is just as well that large lumps of neutron star matter are unknown on Earth. Butsmall lumps are everywhere. The awesome power of the neutron star is lurking in thenucleus of every atom, hidden in every teacup and dormouse, every breath of air, everyapple pie. The neutron star teaches us respect for the commonplace.","903":"A star like the Sun will end its days, as we have seen, as a red giant and then a whitedwarf. A collapsing star twice as massive as the Sun will become a supernova and then aneutron star. But a more massive star, left, after its supernova phase, with, say, five timesthe Sun\u2019s mass, has an even more remarkable fate reserved for it - its gravity will turn itinto a black hole. Suppose we had a magic gravity machine - a device with which we couldcontrol the Earth\u2019s gravity, perhaps by turning a dial. Initially the dial is set at 1 g* andeverything behaves as we have grown up to expect. The animals and plants on Earth andthe structures of our buildings are all evolved or designed for 1 g. If the gravity were muchless, there might be tall, spindly shapes that would not be tumbled or crushed by their ownweight. If the gravity were much more, plants and animals and architecture would have tobe short and squat and sturdy in order not to collapse. But even in a fairly strong gravityfield, light would travel in a straight line, as it does, of course, in everyday life.","904":"* 1 g is the acceleration experienced by falling objects on the Earth, almost 10 meters per secondevery second. A falling rock will reach a speed of 10 meters per second after one second of fall, 20 meters persecond after two seconds, and so on until it strikes the ground or is slowed by friction with the air. On a worldwhere the gravitational acceleration was much greater, falling bodies would increase their speed bycorrespondingly greater amounts. On a world with 10 g acceleration, a rock would travel 10 x 10 m\/sec oralmost 100 m\/sec after the first second, 200 m\/sec after the next second, and so on. A slight stumble could befatal. The acceleration due to gravity should always be written with a lowercase g, to distinguish it from theNewtonian gravitational constant, G, which is a measure of the strength of gravity everywhere in the universe.","905":"not merely on whatever world or sun we are discussing. (The Newtonian relationship of the two quantities isF = mg = GMrn\/r 2 ; g = GM\/r 2 , where F is the gravitational force, M is the mass of the planet or star, m is themass of the falling object, and r is the distance from the falling object to the center of the planet or star.)","906":"Consider a possibly typical group of Earth beings, Alice and her friends from Alicein Wonderland at the Mad Hatter\u2019s tea party. As we lower the gravity, things weigh less.Near 0 g the slightest motion sends our friends floating and tumbling up in the air. Spilledtea - or any other liquid - forms throbbing spherical globs in the air: the surface tension ofthe liquid overwhelms gravity. Balls of tea are everywhere. If now we dial 1 g again, wemake a rain of tea. When we increase the gravity a little - from 1 g to, say, 3 or 4 g\u2019s -everyone becomes immobilized: even moving a paw requires enormous effort. As akindness we remove our friends from the domain of the gravity machine before we dialhigher gravities still. The beam from a lantern travels in a perfectly straight line (as nearlyas we can see) at a few g\u2019s, as it does at 0 g. At 1000 g\u2019s, the beam is still straight, but treeshave become squashed and flattened; at 100,000 g\u2019s, rocks are crushed by their own weight.Eventually, nothing at all survives except, through a special dispensation, the Cheshire cat.When the gravity approaches a billion g\u2019s, something still more strange happens. The beamof light, which has until now been heading straight up into the sky, is beginning to bend.Under extremely strong gravitational accelerations, even light is affected. If we increase thegravity still more, the light is pulled back to the ground near us. Now the cosmic Cheshirecat has vanished; only its gravitational grin remains.","907":"When the gravity is sufficiently high, nothing, not even light, can get out. Such aplace is called a black hole. Enigmatically indifferent to its surroundings, it is a kind ofcosmic Cheshire cat. When the density and gravity become sufficiently high, the black holewinks out and disappears from our universe. That is why it is called black: no light canescape from it. On the inside, because the light is trapped down there, things may beattractively well-lit. Even if a black hole is invisible from the outside, its gravitationalpresence can be palpable. If, on an interstellar voyage, you are not paying attention, youcan find yourself drawn into it irrevocably, your body stretched unpleasantly into a long,thin thread. But the matter accreting into a disk surrounding the black hole would be a sightworth remembering, in the unlikely case that you survived the trip.","908":"Thermonuclear reactions in the solar interior support the outer layers of the Sun andpostpone for billions of years a catastrophic gravitational collapse. For white dwarfs, thepressure of the electrons, stripped from their nuclei, holds the star up. For neutron stars, thepressure of the neutrons staves off gravity. But for an elderly star left after supernovaexplosions and other impetuosities with more than several times the Sun\u2019s mass, there areno forces known that can prevent collapse. The star shrinks incredibly, spins, reddens anddisappears. A star twenty times the mass of the Sun will shrink until it is the size of GreaterLos Angeles; the crushing gravity becomes 10 10 g\u2019s, and the star slips through aself-generated crack in the space-time continuum and vanishes from our universe.","909":"Black holes were first thought of by the English astronomer John Michell in 1783.But the idea seemed so bizarre that it was generally ignored until quite recently. Then, tothe astonishment of many, including many astronomers, evidence was actually found forthe existence of black holes in space. The Earth\u2019s atmosphere is opaque to X-rays. To","910":"determine whether astronomical objects emit such short wavelengths of light, an X-raytelescope must be carried aloft. The first X-ray observatory was an admirably internationaleffort, orbited by the United States from an Italian launch platform in the Indian Ocean offthe coast of Kenya and named Uhuru, the Swahili word for \u2018freedom\u2019. In 1971, Uhurudiscovered a remarkably bright X-ray source in the constellation of Cygnus, the Swan,flickering on and off a thousand times a second. The source, called Cygnus X-l, musttherefore be very small. Whatever the reason for the flicker, information on when to turn onand off can cross Cyg X-l no faster than the speed of light, 300,000 km\/sec. Thus Cyg X-lcan be no larger than [300,000 km\/sec] x [(1\/ 1000) sec] = 300 kilometers across.","911":"Something the size of an asteroid is a brilliant, blinking source of X-rays, visible overinterstellar distances. What could it possibly be? Cyg X-l is in precisely the same place inthe sky as a hot blue supergiant star, which reveals itself in visible light to have a massiveclose but unseen companion that gravitationally tugs it first in one direction and then inanother. The companion\u2019s mass is about ten times that of the Sun. The supergiant is anunlikely source of X-rays, and it is tempting to identify the companion inferred in visiblelight with the source detected in X-ray light. But an invisible object weighing ten timesmore than the Sun and collapsed into a volume the size of an asteroid can only be a blackhole. The X-rays are plausibly generated by friction in the disk of gas and dust accretedaround Cyg X-l from its supergiant companion. Other stars called V861 Scorpii, GX339-4,SS433, and Circinus X-2 are also candidate black holes. Cassiopeia A is the remnant of asupernova whose light should have reached the Earth in the seventeenth century, whenthere were a fair number of astronomers. Yet no one reported the explosion. Perhaps, as I. S.Shklovskii has suggested, there is a black hole hiding there, which ate the exploding stellarcore and damped the fires of the supernova. Telescopes in space are the means for checkingthese shards and fragments of data that may be the spoor, the trail, of the legendary blackhole.","912":"A helpful way to understand black holes is to think about the curvature of space.Consider a flat, flexible, lined two-dimensional surface, like a piece of graph paper made ofrubber. If we drop a small mass, the surface is deformed or puckered. A marble rolls aroundthe pucker in an orbit like that of a planet around the Sun. In this interpretation, which weowe to Einstein, gravity is a distortion in the fabric of space. In our example, we seetwo-dimensional space warped by mass into a third physical dimension. Imagine we live ina three-dimensional universe, locally distorted by matter into a fourth physical dimensionthat we cannot perceive directly. The greater the local mass, the more intense the localgravity, and the more severe the pucker, distortion or warp of space. In this analogy, a blackhole is a kind of bottomless pit. What happens if you fall in? As seen from the outside, youwould take an infinite amount of time to fall in, because all your clocks - mechanical andbiological would be perceived as having stopped. But from your point of view, all yourclocks would be ticking away normally. If you could somehow survive the gravitationaltides and radiation flux, and (a likely assumption) if the black hole were rotating, it is justpossible that you might emerge in another part of space-time - somewhere else in space,somewhere else in time. Such worm holes in space, a little like those in an apple, have beenseriously suggested, although they have by no means been proved to exist. Might gravitytunnels provide a kind of interstellar or intergalactic subway, permitting us to travel to","913":"inaccessible places much more rapidly than we could in the ordinary way? Can black holesserve as time machines, carrying us to the remote past or the distant future?

Whatwould we feel on its seething self-luminous surface, or immersed in its heart of nuclearfire? The Sun warms us and feeds us and permits us to see. It fecundated the Earth. It ispowerful beyond human experience. Birds greet the sunrise with an audible ecstasy. Evensome one-celled organisms know to swim to the light. Our ancestors worshiped the Sun,*and they were far from foolish. And yet the Sun is an ordinary, even a mediocre star. If wemust worship a power greater than ourselves, does it not make sense to revere the Sun andstars? Hidden within every astronomical investigation, sometimes so deeply buried that theresearcher himself is unaware of its presence, lies a kernel of awe.","915":"* The early Sumerian pictograph for god was an asterisk, the symbol of the stars.

It was not that all thematter and energy were squeezed into a minor corner of the present universe; rather, theentire universe, matter and energy and the space they fill, occupied a very small volume.There was not much room for events to happen in.","935":"In that titanic cosmic explosion, the universe began an expansion which has neverceased.

It is better to think of it from the inside, perhaps with grid lines imagined to adhereto the moving fabric of space expanding uniformly in all directions. As space stretched, thematter and energy in the universe expanded with it and rapidly cooled. The radiation of thecosmic fireball, which, then as now, filled the universe, moved through the spectrum - fromgamma rays to X-rays to ultraviolet light; through the rainbow colors of the visiblespectrum; into the infrared and radio regions. The remnants of that fireball, the cosmicbackground radiation, emanating from all parts of the sky can be detected by radiotelescopes today. In the early universe, space was brilliantly illuminated. As time passed,the fabric of space continued to expand, the radiation cooled and, in ordinary visible light,for the first time space became dark, as it is today.","937":"The early universe was filled with radiation and a plenum of matter, originallyhydrogen and helium, formed from elementary particles in the dense primeval fireball.There was very little to see, if there had been anyone around to do the seeing.

Matter was more densely compacted in these lumps than elsewhere. Their gravitydrew to them substantial quantities of nearby gas, growing clouds of hydrogen and heliumthat were destined to become clusters of galaxies. A very small initial nonuniformitysuffices to produce substantial condensations of matter later on.","939":"As the gravitational collapse continued, the primordial galaxies spun increasinglyfaster, because of the conservation of angular momentum. Some flattened, squashingthemselves along the axis of rotation where gravity is not balanced by centrifugal force.These became the first spiral galaxies, great rotating pin-wheels of matter in open space.Other protogalaxies with weaker gravity or less initial rotation flattened very little andbecame the first elliptical galaxies. There are similar galaxies, as if stamped from the samemold, all over the Cosmos because these simple laws of nature - gravity and theconservation of angular momentum - are the same all over the universe. The physics thatworks for falling bodies and pirouetting ice skaters down here in the microcosm of theEarth makes galaxies up there in the macrocosm of the universe.","940":"Within the nascent galaxies, much smaller clouds were also experiencinggravitational collapse; interior temperatures became very high, thermonuclear reactionswere initiated, and the first stars turned on. The hot, massive young stars evolved rapidly,profligates carelessly spending their capital of hydrogen fuel, soon ending their lives inbrilliant supernova explosions, returning thermonuclear ash - helium, carbon, oxygen andheavier elements - to the interstellar gas for subsequent generations of star formation.Supernova explosions of massive early stars produced successive overlapping shock wavesin the adjacent gas, compressing the intergalactic medium and accelerating the generationof clusters of galaxies. Gravity is opportunistic, amplifying even small condensations of","941":"matter. Supernova shock waves may have contributed to accretions of matter at every scale.The epic of cosmic evolution had begun, a hierarchy in the condensation of matter from thegas of the Big Bang - clusters of galaxies, galaxies, stars, planets, and, eventually, life andan intelligence able to understand a little of the elegant process responsible for its origin.","942":"Clusters of galaxies fill the universe today. Some are insignificant, paltry collectionsof a few dozen galaxies. The affectionately titled \u2018Local Group\u2019 contains only two largegalaxies of any size, both spirals: the Milky Way and M31. Other clusters run to immensehordes of thousands of galaxies in mutual gravitational embrace. There is some hint that theVirgo cluster contains tens of thousands of galaxies.","943":"On the largest scale, we inhabit a universe of galaxies, perhaps a hundred billionexquisite examples of cosmic architecture and decay, with order and disorder equallyevident: normal spirals, turned at various angles to our earthly line of sight (face-on we seethe spiral arms, edge-on, the central lanes of gas and dust in which the arms are formed);barred spirals with a river of gas and dust and stars running through the center, connectingthe spiral arms on opposite sides; stately giant elliptical galaxies containing more than atrillion stars which have grown so large because they have swallowed and merged withother galaxies; a plethora of dwarf ellipticals, the galactic midges, each containing somepaltry millions of suns; an immense variety of mysterious irregulars, indications that in theworld of galaxies there are places where something has gone ominously wrong; andgalaxies orbiting each other so closely that their edges are bent by the gravity of theircompanions and in some cases streamers of gas and stars are drawn out gravitationally, abridge between the galaxies.","944":"Some clusters have their galaxies arranged in an unambiguously sphericalgeometry; they are composed chiefly of ellipticals, often dominated by one giant elliptical,the presumptive galactic cannibal. Other clusters with a far more disordered geometry have,comparatively, many more spirals and irregulars. Galactic collisions distort the shape of anoriginally spherical cluster and may also contribute to the genesis of spirals and irregularsfrom ellipticals. The form and abundance of the galaxies have a story to tell us of ancientevents on the largest possible scale, a story we are just beginning to read.","945":"The development of high-speed computers make possible numerical experiments onthe collective motion of thousands or tens of thousands of points, each representing a star,each under the gravitational influence of all the other points. In some cases, spiral armsform all by themselves in a galaxy that has already flattened to a disk. Occasionally a spiralarm may be produced by the close gravitational encounter of two galaxies, each of coursecomposed of billions of stars. The gas and dust diffusely spread through such galaxies willcollide and become warmed. But when two galaxies collide, the stars pass effortlessly byone another, like bullets through a swarm of bees, because a galaxy is made mostly ofnothing and the spaces between the stars are vast. Nevertheless, the configuration of thegalaxies can be distorted severely. A direct impact on one galaxy by another can send theconstituent stars pouring and careening through intergalactic space, a galaxy wasted. Whena small galaxy runs into a larger one face-on it can produce one of the loveliest of the rareirregulars, a ring galaxy thousands of light-years across, set against the velvet ofintergalactic space. It is a splash in the galactic pond, a temporary configuration ofdisrupted stars, a galaxy with a central piece torn out.","946":"The unstructured blobs of irregular galaxies, the arms of spiral galaxies and thetorus of ring galaxies exist for only a few frames in the cosmic motion picture, thendissipate, often to be reformed again. Our sense of galaxies as ponderous rigid bodies ismistaken. They are fluid structures with 100 billion stellar components. Just as a humanbeing, a collection of 100 trillion cells, is typically in a steady state between synthesis anddecay and is more than the sum of its parts, so also is a galaxy.","947":"The suicide rate among galaxies is high. Some nearby examples, tens or hundreds ofmillions of light-years away, are powerful sources of X-rays, infrared radiation and radiowaves, have extremely luminous cores and fluctuate in brightness on time scales of weeks.Some display jets of radiation, thousand-light-year-long plumes, and disks of dust insubstantial disarray. These galaxies are blowing themselves up. Black holes ranging frommillions to billions of times more massive than the Sun are suspected in the cores of giantelliptical galaxies such as NGC 6251 and M87. There is something very massive, verydense, and very small ticking and purring inside M87 - from a region smaller than the solarsystem. A black hole is implicated. Billions of light-years away are still more tumultuousobjects, the quasars, which may be the colossal explosions of young galaxies, the mightiestevents in the history of the universe since the Big Bang itself.","948":"The word \u2018quasar\u2019 is an acronym for \u2018quasi-stellar radio source.\u2019 After it becameclear that not all of them were powerful radio sources, they were called QSO\u2019s(\u2018quasi-stellar objects\u2019). Because they are starlike in appearance, they were naturallythought to be stars within our own galaxy. But spectroscopic observations of their red shift(see below) show them likely to be immense distances away. They seem to partakevigorously in the expansion of the universe, some receding from us at more than 90 percentthe speed of light. If they are very far, they must be intrinsically extremely bright to bevisible over such distances; some are as bright as a thousand supernovae exploding at once.Just as for Cyg X-l, their rapid fluctuations show their enormous brightness to be confinedto a very small volume, in this case less than the size of the solar system. Some remarkableprocess must be responsible for the vast outpouring of energy in a quasar. Among theproposed explanations are: (1) quasars are monster versions of pulsars, with a rapidlyrotating, supermassive core connected to a strong magnetic field; (2) quasars are due tomultiple collisions of millions of stars densely packed into the galactic core, tearing awaythe outer layers and exposing to full view the billion-degree temperatures of the interiors ofmassive stars; (3), a related idea, quasars are galaxies in which the stars are so denselypacked that a supernova explosion in one will rip away the outer layers of another andmake it a supernova, producing a stellar chain reaction; (4) quasars are powered by theviolent mutual annihilation of matter and antimatter, somehow preserved in the quasar untilnow; (5) a quasar is the energy released when gas and dust and stars fall into an immenseblack hole in the core of such a galaxy, perhaps itself the product of ages of collision andcoalescence of smaller black holes; and (6) quasars are \u2018white holes,\u2019 the other side of blackholes, a funneling and eventual emergence into view of matter pouring into a multitude ofblack holes in other parts of the universe, or even in other universes.","949":"In considering the quasars, we confront profound mysteries. Whatever the cause ofa quasar explosion, one thing seems clear: such a violent event must produce untold havoc.In every quasar explosion millions of worlds - some with life and the intelligence to","950":"understand what is happening - may be utterly destroyed. The study of the galaxies revealsa universal order and beauty. It also shows us chaotic violence on a scale hithertoundreamed of. That we live in a universe which permits life is remarkable. That we live inone which destroys galaxies and stars and worlds is also remarkable. The universe seemsneither benign nor hostile, merely indifferent to the concerns of such puny creatures as we.","951":"Even a galaxy so seemingly well-mannered as the Milky Way has its stirrings andits dances. Radio observations show two enormous clouds of hydrogen gas, enough tomake millions of suns, plummeting out from the galactic core, as if a mild explosionhappened there every now and then. A high-energy astronomical observatory in Earth orbithas found the galactic core to be a strong source of a particular gamma ray spectral line,consistent with the idea that a massive black hole is hidden there. Galaxies like the MilkyWay may represent the staid middle age in a continuous evolutionary sequence, whichencompasses, in their violent adolescence, quasars, and exploding galaxies: because thequasars are so distant, we see them in their youth, as they were billions of years ago.","952":"The stars of the Milky Way move with systematic grace. Globular clusters plungethrough the galactic plane and out the other side, where they slow, reverse and hurtle backagain. If we could follow the motion of individual stars bobbing about the galactic plane,they would resemble a froth of popcorn. We have never seen a galaxy change its formsignificantly only because it takes so long to move. The Milky Way rotates once everyquarter billion years. If we were to speed the rotation, we would see that the Galaxy is adynamic, almost organic entity, in some ways resembling a multi-cellular organism. Anyastronomical photograph of a galaxy is merely a snapshot of one stage in its ponderousmotion and evolution.* The inner region of a galaxy rotates as a solid body. But, beyondthat, like the planets around the Sun following Kepler\u2019s third law, the outer provinces rotateprogressively more slowly. The arms have a tendency to wind up around the core in anever-tightening spiral, and gas and dust accumulate in spiral patterns of greater density,which are in turn the locales for the formation of young, hot, bright stars, the stars thatoutline the spiral arms. These stars shine for ten million years or so, a period correspondingto only 5 percent of a galactic rotation. But as the stars that outline a spiral arm burn out,new stars and their associated nebulae are formed just behind them, and the spiral patternpersists. The stars that outline the arms do not survive even a single galactic rotation; onlythe spiral pattern remains.","953":"* This is not quite true. The near side of a galaxy is tens of thousands of light-years closer to us thanthe far side; thus we see the front as it was tens of thousands of years before the back. But typical events ingalactic dynamics occupy tens of millions of years, so the error in thinking of an image of a galaxy as frozenin one moment of time is small.","954":"The speed of any given star around the center of the Galaxy is generally not thesame as that of the spiral pattern. The Sun has been in and out of spiral arms often in thetwenty times it has gone around the Milky Way at 200 kilometers per second (roughly halfa million miles per hour). On the average, the Sun and the planets spend forty million yearsin a spiral arm, eighty million outside, another forty million in, and so on. Spiral armsoutline the region where the latest crop of newly hatched stars is being formed, but not","955":"necessarily where such middle-aged stars as the Sun happen to be. In this epoch, we livebetween spiral arms.","956":"The periodic passage of the solar system through spiral arms may conceivably havehad important consequences for us. About ten million years ago, the Sun emerged from theGould Belt complex of the Orion Spiral Arm, which is now a little less than a thousandlight-years away. (Interior to the Orion arm is the Sagittarius arm; beyond the Orion arm isthe Perseus arm.) When the Sun passes through a spiral arm it is more likely than it is atpresent to enter into gaseous nebulae and interstellar dust clouds and to encounter objectsof substellar mass. It has been suggested that the major ice ages on our planet, which recurevery hundred million years or so, may be due to the interposition of interstellar matterbetween the Sun and the Earth. W. Napier and S. Clube have proposed that a number of themoons, asteroids, comets and circumplanetary rings in the solar system once freelywandered in interstellar space until they were captured as the Sun plunged through theOrion spiral arm. This is an intriguing idea, although perhaps not very likely. But it istestable. All we need do is procure a sample of, say, Phobos or a comet and examine itsmagnesium isotopes. The relative abundance of magnesium isotopes (all sharing the samenumber of protons, but having differing numbers of neutrons) depends on the precisesequence of stellar nucleosynthetic events, including the timing of nearby supernovaexplosions, that produced any particular sample of magnesium. In a different corner of theGalaxy, a different sequence of events should have occurred and a different ratio ofmagnesium isotopes should prevail.","957":"The discovery of the Big Bang and the recession of the galaxies came from acommonplace of nature called the Doppler effect. We are used to it in the physics of sound.An automobile driver speeding by us blows his horn. Inside the car, the driver hears asteady blare at a fixed pitch. But outside the car, we hear a characteristic change in pitch.To us, the sound of the horn elides from high frequencies to low. A racing car traveling at200 kilometers per hour (120 miles her hour) is going almost one-fifth the speed of sound.Sound is a succession of waves in air, a crest and a trough, a crest and a trough. The closertogether the waves are, the higher the frequency or pitch; the farther apart the waves are,the lower the pitch. If the car is racing away from us, it stretches out the sound waves,moving them, from our point of view, to a lower pitch and producing the characteristicsound with which we are all familiar. If the car were racing toward us, the sound waveswould be squashed together, the frequency would be increased, and we would hear ahigh-pitched wail. If we knew what the ordinary pitch of the horn was when the car was atrest, we could deduce its speed blindfolded, from the change in pitch.","958":"Light is also a wave. Unlike sound, it travels perfectly well through a vacuum. TheDoppler effect works here as well. If instead of sound the automobile were for some reasonemitting, front and back, a beam of pure yellow light, the frequency of the light wouldincrease slightly as the car approached and decrease slightly as the car receded. At ordinaryspeeds the effect would be imperceptible. If, however, the car were somehow traveling at agood fraction of the speed of light, we would be able to observe the color of the lightchanging toward higher frequency, that is, toward blue, as the car approached us; andtoward lower frequencies, that is, toward red, as the car receded from us. An objectapproaching us at very high velocities is perceived to have the color of its spectral lines","959":"blue-shifted. An object receding from us at very high velocities has its spectral linesred-shifted.* This red shift, observed in the spectral lines of distant galaxies and interpretedas a Doppler effect, is the key to cosmology.","960":"* The object itself might be any color, even blue. The red shift means only that each spectral lineappears at longer wavelengths than when the object is at rest; the amount of the red shift is proportional bothto the velocity and to the wavelength of the spectral line when the object is at rest.","961":"During the early years of this century, the world\u2019s largest telescope, destined todiscover the red shift of remote galaxies, was being built on Mount Wilson, overlookingwhat were then the clear skies of Los Angeles. Large pieces of the telescope had to behauled to the top of the mountain, a job for mule teams. A young mule skinner namedMilton Humason helped to transport mechanical and optical equipment, scientists,engineers and dignitaries up the mountain. Humason would lead the column of mules onhorseback, his white terrier standing just behind the saddle, its front paws on Humason\u2019sshoulders. He was a tobacco-chewing roustabout, a superb gambler and pool player andwhat was then called a ladies\u2019 man. In his formal education, he had never gone beyond theeighth grade. But he was bright and curious and naturally inquisitive about the equipmenthe had laboriously carted to the heights. Humason was keeping company with the daughterof one of the observatory engineers, a man who harbored reservations about his daughterseeing a young man who had no higher ambition than to be a mule skinner. So Humasontook odd jobs at the observatory - electrician\u2019s assistant, janitor, swabbing the floors of thetelescope he had helped to build. One evening, so the story goes, the night telescopeassistant fell ill and Humason was asked if he might fill in. He displayed such skill and carewith the instruments that he soon became a permanent telescope operator and observingaide.","962":"After World War I, there came to Mount Wilson the soon-to-be famous EdwinHubble - brilliant, polished, gregarious outside the astronomical community, with anEnglish accent acquired during a single year as Rhodes scholar at Oxford. It was Hubblewho provided the final demonstration that the spiral nebulae were in fact \u2018island universes,\u2019distant aggregations of enormous numbers of stars, like our own Milky Way Galaxy; hehad figured out the stellar standard candle required to measure the distances to the galaxies.Hubble and Humason hit it off splendidly, a perhaps unlikely pair who worked together atthe telescope harmoniously. Following a lead by the astronomer V. M. Slipher at LowellObservatory, they began measuring the spectra of distant galaxies. It soon became clear thatHumason was better able to obtain high-quality spectra of distant galaxies than anyprofessional astronomer in the world. He became a full staff member of the Mount WilsonObservatory, learned many of the scientific underpinnings of his work and died rich in therespect of the astronomical community.","963":"The light from a galaxy is the sum of the light emitted by the billions of stars withinit. As the light leaves these stars, certain frequencies or colors are absorbed by the atoms inthe stars\u2019 outermost layers. The resulting lines permit us to tell that stars millions oflight-years away contain the same chemical elements as our Sun and the nearby stars.Humason and Hubble found, to their amazement, that the spectra of all the distant galaxies","964":"are red-shifted and, still more startling, that the more distant the galaxy was, the morered-shifted were its spectral lines.","965":"The most obvious explanation of the red shift was in terms of the Doppler effect:the galaxies were receding from us; the more distant the galaxy the greater its speed ofrecession. But why should the galaxies be fleeing us? Could there be something specialabout our location in the universe, as if the Milky Way had performed some inadvertent butoffensive act in the social life of galaxies? It seemed much more likely that the universeitself was expanding, carrying the galaxies with it. Humason and Hubble, it graduallybecame clear, had discovered the Big Bang - if not the origin of the universe then at least itsmost recent incarnation.","966":"Almost all of modern cosmology - and especially the idea of an expanding universeand a Big Bang - is based on the idea that the red shift of distant galaxies is a Dopplereffect and arises from their speed of recession. But there are other kinds of red shifts innature. There is, for example, the gravitational red shift, in which the light leaving anintense gravitational field has to do so much work to escape that it loses energy during thejourney, the process perceived by a distant observer as a shift of the escaping light to longerwavelengths and redder colors. Since we think there may be massive black holes at thecenters of some galaxies, this is a conceivable explanation of their red shifts. However, theparticular spectral lines observed are often characteristic of very thin, diffuse gas, and notthe astonishingly high density that must prevail near black holes. Or the red shift might be aDoppler effect due not to the general expansion of the universe but rather to a more modestand local galactic explosion. But then we should expect as many explosion fragmentstraveling toward us as away from us, as many blue shifts as red shifts. What we actually see,however, is almost exclusively red shifts no matter what distant objects beyond the LocalGroup we point our telescopes to.","967":"There is nevertheless a nagging suspicion among some astronomers that all may notbe right with the deduction, from the red shifts of galaxies via the Doppler effect, that theuniverse is expanding. The astronomer Halton Arp has found enigmatic and disturbingcases where a galaxy and a quasar, or a pair of galaxies, that are in apparent physicalassociation have very different red shifts. Occasionally there seems to be a bridge of gasand dust and stars connecting them. If the red shift is due to the expansion of the universe,very different red shifts imply very different distances. But two galaxies that are physicallyconnected can hardly also be greatly separated from each other - in some cases by a billionlight-years. Skeptics say that the association is purely statistical: that, for example, a nearbybright galaxy and a much more distant quasar, each having very different red shifts andvery different speeds of recession, are merely accidentally aligned along the line of sight;that they have no real physical association. Such statistical alignments must happen bychance every now and then. The debate centers on whether the number of coincidences ismore than would be expected by chance. Arp points to other cases in which a galaxy with asmall red shift is flanked by two quasars of large and almost identical red shift. He believesthe quasars are not at cosmological distances but instead are being ejected, left and right, bythe \u2018foreground\u2019 galaxy; and that the red shifts are the result of some as-yet-unfathomedmechanism. Skeptics argue coincidental alignment and the conventional Hubble-Humasoninterpretation of the red shift. If Arp is right, the exotic mechanisms proposed to explain the","968":"energy source of distant quasars - supernova chain reactions, supermassive black holes andthe like - would prove unnecessary. Quasars need not then be very distant. But some otherexotic mechanism will be required to explain the red shift. In either case, something verystrange is going on in the depths of space.","969":"The apparent recession of the galaxies, with the red shift interpreted through theDoppler effect, is not the only evidence for the Big Bang. Independent and quite persuasiveevidence derives from the cosmic black body background radiation, the faint static of radiowaves coming quite uniformly from all directions in the Cosmos at just the intensityexpected in our epoch from the now substantially cooled radiation of the Big Bang. Buthere also there is something puzzling. Observations with a sensitive radio antenna carriednear the top of the Earth\u2019s atmosphere in a U-2 aircraft have shown that the backgroundradiation is, to first approximation, just as intense in all directions - as if the fireball of theBig Bang expanded quite uniformly, an origin of the universe with a very precise symmetry.But the background radiation, when examined to finer precision, proves to be imperfectlysymmetrical. There is a small systematic effect that could be understood if the entire MilkyWay Galaxy (and presumably other members of the Local Group) were streaking towardthe Virgo cluster of galaxies at more than a million miles an hour (600 kilometers persecond). At such a rate, we will reach it in ten billion years, and extragalactic astronomywill then be a great deal easier. The Virgo cluster is already the richest collection ofgalaxies known, replete with spirals and ellipticals and irregulars, a jewel box in the sky.","970":"But why should we be rushing toward it? George Smoot and his colleagues, who madethese high-altitude observations, suggest that the Milky Way is being gravitationallydragged toward the center of the Virgo cluster; that the cluster has many more galaxies thanhave been detected heretofore; and, most startling, that the cluster is of immenseproportions, stretching across one or two billion light-years of space.","971":"The observable universe itself is only a few tens of billions of light-years across and,if there is a vast supercluster in the Virgo group, perhaps there are other such superclustersat much greater distances, which are correspondingly more difficult to detect. In thelifetime of the universe there has apparently not been enough time for an initialgravitational nonuniformity to collect the amount of mass that seems to reside in the Virgosupercluster. Thus Smoot is tempted to conclude that the Big Bang was much less uniformthan his other observations suggest, that the original distribution of matter in the universewas very lumpy. (Some little lumpiness is to be expected, and indeed even needed tounderstand the condensation of galaxies; but a lumpiness on this scale is a surprise.)","972":"Perhaps the paradox can be resolved by imagining two or more nearly simultaneous BigBangs.","973":"If the general picture of an expanding universe and a Big Bang is correct, we mustthen confront still more difficult questions. What were conditions like at the time of the BigBang? What happened before that? Was there a tiny universe, devoid of all matter, and thenthe matter suddenly created from nothing? How does that happen? In many cultures it iscustomary to answer that God created the universe out of nothing. But this is meretemporizing. If we wish courageously to pursue the question, we must, of course ask nextwhere God comes from. And if we decide this to be unanswerable, why not save a step anddecide that the origin of the universe is an unanswerable question? Or, if we say that God","974":"has always existed, why not save a step and conclude that the universe has always existed?","975":"Every culture has a myth of the world before creation, and of the creation of theworld, often by the mating of the gods or the hatching of a cosmic egg.

Itis the only religion in which the time scales correspond, no doubt by accident, to those ofmodern scientific cosmology.

Meanwhile, elsewhere, there are an infinitenumber of other universes, each with its own god dreaming the cosmic dream. These greatideas are tempered by another, perhaps still greater.

The expansion maygradually slow, stop and reverse itself. If there is less than a certain critical amount ofmatter in the universe, the gravitation of the receding galaxies will be insufficient to stopthe expansion, and the universe will run away forever. But if there is more matter than wecan see - hidden away in black holes, say, or in hot but invisible gas between the galaxies -then the universe will hold together gravitationally and partake of a very Indian successionof cycles, expansion followed by contraction, universe upon universe, Cosmos without end.If we live in such an oscillating universe, then the Big Bang is not the creation of theCosmos but merely the end of the previous cycle, the destruction of the last incarnation ofthe Cosmos.","992":"* The dates on Mayan inscriptions also range deep into the past and occasionally far into the future.One inscription refers to a time more than a million years ago and another perhaps refers to events of 400million years ago, although this is in some dispute among Mayan scholars.

It is easy to see that only avery restricted range of laws of nature are consistent with galaxies and stars, planets, lifeand intelligence.

Thus we can deduce from the fact that the universe exists either a finite age, or asevere restriction on the kinds of laws of nature permitted in each oscillation. If the laws of physics are notrandomly reshuffled at the cusps, there must be a regularity, a set of rules, that determines which laws arepermissible and which are not. Such a set of rules would comprise a new physics standing over the existingphysics. Our language is impoverished; there seems to be no suitable name for such a new physics. Both\u2018paraphysics\u2019 and \u2018metaphysics\u2019 have been preempted by other rather different and, quite possibly, whollyirrelevant activities. Perhaps \u2018transphysics\u2019 would do.","998":"Do we live in a universe that expands forever or in one in which there is an infiniteset of cycles? There are ways to find out: by making an accurate census of the total amountof matter in the universe, or by seeing to the edge of the Cosmos.","999":"Radio telescopes can detect very faint, very distant objects. As we look deep intospace we also look far back into time. The nearest quasar is perhaps half a billionlight-years away. The farthest may be ten or twelve or more billions. But if we see an","1000":"object twelve billion light-years away, we are seeing it as it was twelve billion years ago intime. By looking far out into space we are also looking far back into time, back toward thehorizon of the universe, back toward the epoch of the Big Bang.","1001":"The Very Large Array (VLA) is a collection of twenty-seven separate radiotelescopes in a remote region of New Mexico. It is a phased array, the individual telescopeselectronically connected, as if it were a single telescope of the same size as its remotestelements, as if it were a radio telescope tens of kilometers across. The VLA is able toresolve or discriminate fine detail in the radio regions of the spectrum comparable to whatthe largest ground-based telescopes can do in the optical region of the spectrum.","1002":"Sometimes such radio telescopes are connected with telescopes on the other side ofthe Earth, forming a baseline comparable to the Earth\u2019s diameter - in a certain sense, atelescope as large as the planet. In the future we may have telescopes in the Earth\u2019s orbit,around toward the other side of the Sun, in effect a radio telescope as large as the innersolar system. Such telescopes may reveal the internal structure and nature of quasars.Perhaps a quasar standard candle will be found, and the distances to the quasars determinedindependent of their red shifts. By understanding the structure and the red shift of the mostdistant quasars it may be possible to see whether the expansion of the universe was fasterbillions of years ago, whether the expansion is slowing down, whether the universe will oneday collapse.","1003":"Modern radio telescopes are exquisitely sensitive; a distant quasar is so faint that itsdetected radiation amounts perhaps to a quadrillionth of a watt. The total amount of energyfrom outside the solar system ever received by ah the radio telescopes on the planet Earth isless than the energy of a single snowflake striking the ground. In detecting the cosmicbackground radiation, in counting quasars, in searching for intelligent signals from space,radio astronomers are dealing with amounts of energy that are barely there at all.","1004":"Some matter, particularly the matter in the stars, glows in visible light and is easy tosee. Other matter, gas and dust in the outskirts of galaxies, for example, is not so readilydetected. It does not give off visible light, although it seems to give off radio waves. This isone reason that the unlocking of the cosmological mysteries requires us to use exoticinstruments and frequencies different from the visible light to which our eyes are sensitive.Observatories in Earth orbit have found an intense X-ray glow between the galaxies. It wasfirst thought to be hot intergalactic hydrogen, an immense amount of it never before seen,perhaps enough to close the Cosmos and to guarantee that we are trapped in an oscillatinguniverse. But more recent observations by Ricardo Giacconi may have resolved the X-rayglow into individual points, perhaps an immense horde of distant quasars. They contributepreviously unknown mass to the universe as well. When the cosmic inventory is completed,and the mass of all the galaxies, quasars, black holes, intergalactic hydrogen, gravitationalwaves and still more exotic denizens of space is summed up, we will know what kind ofuniverse we inhabit.","1005":"In discussing the large-scale structure of the Cosmos, astronomers are fond ofsaying that space is curved, or that there is no center to the Cosmos, or that the universe isfinite but unbounded. Whatever are they talking about? Let us imagine we inhabit a strangecountry where everyone is perfectly flat. Following Edwin Abbott, a Shakespearean scholarwho lived in Victorian England, we call it Flatland. Some of us are squares; some are","1006":"triangles; some have more complex shapes. We scurry about, in and out of our flatbuildings, occupied with our flat businesses and dalliances. Everyone in Flatland has widthand length, but no height whatever.

Where is it?\u2019 So the mathematicians, disheartened, amble off.Nobody listens to mathematicians.","1008":"Every square creature in Flatland sees another square as merely a short line segment,the side of the square nearest to him. He can see the other side of the square only by takinga short walk. But the inside of a square is forever mysterious, unless some terrible accidentor autopsy breaches the sides and exposes the interior parts.","1009":"One day a three-dimensional creature - shaped like an apple, say - comes uponFlatland, hovering above it. Observing a particularly attractive and congenial-lookingsquare entering its flat house, the apple decides, in a gesture of interdimensional amity, tosay hello. \u2018How are you?\u2019 asks the visitor from the third dimension. \u2018I am a visitor from thethird dimension.\u2019 The wretched square looks about his closed house and sees no one. Whatis worse, to him it appears that the greeting, entering from above, is emanating from hisown flat body, a voice from within. A little insanity, he perhaps reminds himself gamely,runs in the family.","1010":"Exasperated at being judged a psychological aberration, the apple descends intoFlatland. Now a three-dimensional creature can exist, in Flatland, only partially; only across section can be seen, only the points of contact with the plane surface of Flatland. Anapple slithering through Flatland would appear first as a point and then as progressivelylarger, roughly circular slices. The square sees a point appearing in a closed room in histwo-dimensional world and slowly growing into a near circle. A creature of strange andchanging shape has appeared from nowhere.","1011":"Rebuffed, unhappy at the obtuseness of the very flat, the apple bumps the squareand sends him aloft, fluttering and spinning into that mysterious third dimension. At firstthe square can make no sense of what is happening; it is utterly outside his experience. Buteventually he realizes that he is viewing Flatland from a peculiar vantage point: \u2018above\u2019. Hecan see into closed rooms. He can see into his flat fellows. He is viewing his universe froma unique and devastating perspective. Traveling through another dimension provides, as anincidental benefit, a kind of X-ray vision. Eventually, like a falling leaf, our square slowlydescends to the surface. From the point of view of his fellow Flatlanders, he hasunaccountably disappeared from a closed room and then distressingly materialized fromnowhere. \u2018For heaven\u2019s sake,\u2019 they say, \u2018what\u2019s happened to you?\u2019 \u2018I think,\u2019 he findshimself replying, \u2018I was \u201cup.\u201d \u2019 They pat him on his sides and comfort him. Delusionsalways ran in his family.","1012":"In such interdimensional contemplations, we need not be restricted to twodimensions. We can, following Abbott, imagine a world of one dimension, where everyoneis a line segment, or even the magical world of zero-dimensional beasts, the points. Butperhaps more interesting is the question of higher dimensions. Could there be a fourth","1013":"physical dimension?*","1014":"* If a fourth-dimensional creature existed it could, in our three-dimensional universe, appear anddematerialize at will, change shape remarkably, pluck us out of locked rooms and make us appear fromnowhere. It could also turn us inside out. There are several ways in which we can be turned inside out: theleast pleasant would result in our viscera and internal organs being on the outside and the entire Cosmos -glowing intergalactic gas, galaxies, planets, everything - on the inside. I am not sure I like the idea.","1015":"We can imagine generating a cube in the following way: Take a line segment of acertain length and move it an equal length at right angles to itself. That makes a square.Move the square an equal length at right angles to itself, and we have a cube. Weunderstand this cube to cast a shadow, which we usually draw as two squares with theirvertices connected. If we examine the shadow of a cube in two dimensions, we notice thatnot all the lines appear equal, and not all the angles are right angles. The three-dimensionalobject has not been perfectly represented in its transfiguration into two dimensions. This isthe cost of losing a dimension in the geometrical projection. Now let us take ourthree-dimensional cube and carry it, at right angles to itself, through a fourth physicaldimension: not left-right, not forward-back, not up-down, but simultaneously at right anglesto all those directions. I cannot show you what direction that is, but I can imagine it to exist.In such a case, we would have generated a four-dimensional hypercube, also called atesseract. I cannot show you a tesseract, because we are trapped in three dimensions. Butwhat I can show you is the shadow in three dimensions of a tesseract. It resembles twonested cubes, all the vertices connected by lines. But for a real tesseract, in four dimensions,all the lines would be of equal length and all the angles would be right angles.","1016":"Imagine a universe just like Flatland, except that unbeknownst to the inhabitants,their two-dimensional universe is curved through a third physical dimension. When theFlatlanders take short excursions, their universe looks flat enough. But if one of them takesa long enough walk along what seems to be a perfectly straight line, he uncovers a greatmystery: although he has not reached a barrier and has never turned around, he hassomehow come back to the place from which he started. His two-dimensional universemust have been warped, bent or curved through a mysterious third dimension. He cannotimagine that third dimension, but he can deduce it. Increase all dimensions in this story byone, and you have a situation that may apply to us.","1017":"Where is the center of the Cosmos? Is there an edge to the universe? What liesbeyond that? In a two-dimensional universe, curved through a third dimension, there is nocenter - at least not on the surface of the sphere. The center of such a universe is not in thatuniverse; it lies, inaccessible, in the third dimension, inside the sphere. While there is onlyso much area on the surface of the sphere, there is no edge to this universe - it is finite butunbounded. And the question of what lies beyond is meaningless. Flat creatures cannot, ontheir own, escape their two dimensions.","1018":"Increase all dimensions by one, and you have the situation that may apply to us: theuniverse as a four-dimensional hypersphere with no center and no edge, and nothingbeyond.

Sometime after the expansion begins, galaxies condenseand are carried outward on the surface of the hypersphere. There are astronomers in eachgalaxy, and the light they see is also trapped on the curved surface of the hypersphere. Asthe sphere expands, an astronomer in any galaxy will think all the other galaxies arerunning away from him. There are no privileged reference frames.* The farther away thegalaxy, the faster its recession. The galaxies are embedded in, attached to space, and thefabric of space is expanding. And to the question, Where in the present universe did the BigBang occur? the answer is clearly, everywhere.","1020":"* The view that the universe looks by and large the same no matter from where we happen to view itwas first proposed, so far as we know, by Giordano Bruno.","1021":"If there is insufficient matter to prevent the universe from expanding forever, itmust have an open shape, curved like a saddle with a surface extending to infinity in ourthree-dimensional analogy.

In the 1920\u2019s, in a direction opposite to M31, observers found a distant pair of spiralgalaxies. Was it possible, they wondered, that they were seeing the Milky Way and M31from the other direction - like seeing the back of your head with light that hascircumnavigated the universe? We now know that the universe is much larger than theyimagined in the 1920\u2019s. It would take more than the age of the universe for light tocircumnavigate it. And the galaxies are younger than the universe. But if the Cosmos isclosed and light cannot escape from it, then it may be perfectly correct to describe theuniverse as a black hole. If you wish to know what it is like inside a black hole, look aroundyou.","1022":"We have previously mentioned the possibility of wormholes to get from one placein the universe to another without covering the intervening distance - through a black hole.We can imagine these wormholes as tubes running through a fourth physical dimension.","1023":"We do not know that such wormholes exist.

Knowing agreat deal is not the same as being smart; intelligence is not information alone but alsojudgment, the manner in which information is coordinated and used. Still, the amount ofinformation to which we have access is one index of our intelligence. The measuring rod,the unit of information, is something called a bit (for binary digit). It is an answer - eitheryes or no - to an unambiguous question. To specify whether a lamp is on or off requires asingle bit of information.

In this rich aquaticenvironment, many relatively intelligent creatures live - some with eight appendages forgrasping; others that communicate among themselves by changing an intricate pattern ofbright and dark mottling on their bodies; even clever little creatures from the land whomake brief forays into the ocean in vessels of wood or metal. But we seek the dominantintelligences, the grandest creatures on the planet, the sentient and graceful masters of thedeep ocean, the great whales.","1043":"They are the largest animals* ever to evolve on the planet Earth, larger by far thanthe dinosaurs. An adult blue whale can be thirty meters long and weigh 150 tons. Many,especially the baleen whales, are placid browsers, straining through vast volumes of oceanfor the small animals on which they graze; others eat fish and krill. The whales are recentarrivals in the ocean. Only seventy million years ago their ancestors were carnivorousmammals who migrated in slow steps from the land into the ocean. Among the whales,mothers suckle and care tenderly for their offspring. There is a long childhood in which theadults teach the young. Play is a typical pastime. These are all mammalian characteristics,all important for the development of intelligent beings.","1044":"* Some sequoia trees are both larger and more massive than any whale.","1045":"The sea is murky. Sight and smell, which work well for mammals on the land, arenot of much use in the depths of the ocean. Those ancestors of the whales who relied onthese senses to locate a mate or a baby or a predator did not leave many offspring. Soanother method was perfected by evolution; it works superbly well and is central to anyunderstanding of the whales: the sense of sound. Some whale sounds are called songs, butwe are still ignorant of their true nature and meaning. They range over a broad band offrequencies, down to well below the lowest sound the human ear can detect. A typicalwhale song lasts for perhaps fifteen minutes; the longest, about an hour. Often it is repeated,identically, beat for beat, measure for measure, note for note. Occasionally a group ofwhales will leave their winter waters in the midst of a song and six months later return tocontinue at precisely the right note, as if there had been no interruption. Whales are verygood at remembering. More often, on their return, the vocalizations have changed. Newsongs appear on the cetacean hit parade.","1046":"Very often the members of the group will sing the same song together. By somemutual consensus, some collaborative songwriting, the piece changes month by month,slowly and predictably. These vocalizations are complex. If the songs of the humpbackwhale are enunciated as a tonal language, the total information content, the number of bitsof information in such songs, is some 10 6 bits, about the same as the information content ofthe Iliad or the Odyssey. We do not know what whales or their cousins the dolphins have totalk or sing about. They have no manipulative organs, they make no engineering constructs,but they are social creatures. They hunt, swim, fish, browse, frolic, mate, play, run frompredators. There may be a great deal to talk about.","1047":"The primary danger to the whales is a newcomer, an upstart animal, only recently,through technology, become competent in the oceans, a creature that calls itself human. For99.99 percent of the history of the whales, there were no humans in or on the deep oceans.During this period the whales evolved their extraordinary audio communication system.","1048":"The finbacks, for example, emit extremely loud sounds at a frequency of twenty Hertz,down near the lowest octave on the piano keyboard.. (A Hertz is a unit of sound frequencythat represents one sound wave, one crest and one trough, entering your ear every second.)Such low-frequency sounds are scarcely absorbed in the ocean. The American biologistRoger Payne has calculated that using the deep ocean sound channel, two whales couldcommunicate with each other at twenty Hertz essentially anywhere in the world. One mightbe off the Ross Ice Shelf in Antarctica and communicate with another in the Aleutians. Formost of their history, the whales may have established a global communications network.Perhaps when separated by 15,000 kilometers, their vocalizations are love songs, casthopefully into the vastness of the deep.","1049":"For tens of millions of years these enormous, intelligent, communicative creaturesevolved with essentially no natural enemies. Then the development of the steamship in thenineteenth century introduced an ominous source of noise pollution. As commercial andmilitary vessels became more abundant, the noise background in the oceans, especially at afrequency of twenty Hertz, became noticeable. Whales communicating across the oceansmust have experienced increasingly greater difficulties. The distance over which they couldcommunicate must have decreased steadily. Two hundred years ago, a typical distanceacross which finbacks could communicate was perhaps 10,000 kilometers. Today, thecorresponding number is perhaps a few hundred kilometers. Do whales know each other'snames? Can they recognize each other as individuals by sounds alone? We have cut thewhales off from themselves. Creatures that communicated for tens of millions of years havenow effectively been silenced.*","1050":"* There is a curious counterpoint to this story. The preferred radio channel for interstellarcommunication with other technical civilizations is near a frequency of 1.42 billion Hertz, marked by a radiospectral line of hydrogen, the most abundant atom in the Universe. We are just beginning to listen here forsignals of intelligent origin. But the frequency band is being increasingly encroached upon by civilian andmilitary communications traffic on Earth, and not only by the major powers. We are jamming the interstellarchannel. Uncontrolled growth of terrestrial radio technology may prevent us from ready communication withintelligent beings on distant worlds. Their songs may go unanswered because we have not the will to controlour radio-frequency pollution and listen.","1051":"And we have done worse than that, because there persists to this day a traffic in thedead bodies of whales. There are humans who hunt and slaughter whales and market theproducts for lipstick or industrial lubricant. Many nations understand that the systematicmurder of such intelligent creatures is monstrous, but the traffic continues, promotedchiefly by Japan, Norway and the Soviet Union. We humans, as a species, are interested incommunication with extraterrestrial intelligence. Would not a good beginning be improvedcommunication with terrestrial intelligence, with other human beings of different culturesand languages, with the great apes, with the dolphins, but particularly with those intelligentmasters of the deep, the, great whales?","1052":"For a whale to live there are many things it must know how to do. This knowledgeis stored in its genes and in its brain. The genetic information includes how to convertplankton into blubber; or how to hold your breath on a dive one kilometer below thesurface. The information in the brain, the learned information, includes such things as whoyour mother is, or the meaning of the song you are hearing just now. The whale, like all theother animals on the Earth, has a gene library and a brain library.","1053":"The genetic material of the whale, like the genetic material of human beings, ismade of nucleic acids, those extraordinary molecules capable of reproducing themselvesfrom the chemical building blocks that surround them, and of turning hereditaryinformation into action. For example, one whale enzyme, identical to one you have in everycell of your body, is called hexokinase, the first of more than two dozen enzyme-mediatedsteps required to convert a molecule of sugar obtained from the plankton in the whale's dietinto a little energy - perhaps a contribution to a single low-frequency note in the music ofthe whale.","1054":"The information stored in the DNA double helix of a whale or a human or any otherbeast or vegetable on Earth is written in a language of four letters - the four different kindsof nucleotides, the molecular components that make up DNA. How many bits ofinformation are contained in the hereditary material of various life forms? How manyyes\/no answers to the various biological questions are written in the language of life? Avirus needs about 10,000 bits - roughly equivalent to the amount of information on thispage. But the viral information is simple, exceedingly compact, extraordinarily efficient.Reading it requires very close attention. These are the instructions it needs to infect someother organism and to reproduce itself - the only things that viruses are any good at. Abacterium uses roughly a million bits of information - which is about 100 printed pages.Bacteria have a lot more to do than viruses. Unlike the viruses, they are not thoroughgoingparasites. Bacteria have to make a living. And a free-swimming one-celled amoeba is muchmore sophisticated; with about four hundred million bits in its DNA, it would require someeighty 500-page volumes to make another amoeba.","1055":"A whale or a human being needs something like five billion bits.

Every cell inyour body arises by successive cell divisions from a single cell, a fertilized egg generatedby your parents. Every time that cell divided, in the many embryological steps that wentinto making you, the original set of genetic instructions was duplicated with great fidelity.So your liver cells have some unemployed knowledge about how to make your bone cells,and vice versa. The genetic library contains everything your body knows how to do on itsown.

In fact, if I had to synthesizemy own enzymes, if I consciously had to remember and direct all the chemical stepsrequired to get energy out of food, I would probably starve.

Suppose the environment was changing so fast that the precoded geneticencyclopaedia, which served perfectly well before, was no longer entirely adequate. Theneven a gene library of 1,000 volumes would not be enough. That is why we have brains.","1059":"Like all our organs, the brain has evolved, increasing in complexity and informationcontent, over millions of years. Its structure reflects all the stages through which it haspassed. The brain evolved from the inside out. Deep inside is the oldest part, the brainstem,which conducts the basic biological functions, including the rhythms of life - heartbeat andrespiration. According to a provocative insight by Paul MacLean, the higher functions ofthe brain evolved in three successive stages. Capping the brainstem is the R-complex, theseat of aggression, ritual, territoriality and social hierarchy, which evolved hundreds ofmillions of years ago in our reptilian ancestors. Deep inside the skull of every one of usthere is something like the brain of a crocodile. Surrounding the R-complex is the limbicsystem or mammalian brain, which evolved tens of millions of years ago in ancestors whowere mammals but not yet primates. It is a major source of our moods and emotions, of ourconcern and care for the young.","1060":"And finally, on the outside, living in uneasy truce with the more primitive brainsbeneath, is the cerebral cortex, which evolved millions of years ago in our primateancestors. The cerebral cortex, where matter is transformed into consciousness, is the pointof embarkation for all our cosmic voyages. Comprising more than two-thirds of the brainmass, it is the realm of both intuition and critical analysis. It is here that we have ideas andinspirations, here that we read and write, here that we do mathematics and compose music.The cortex regulates our conscious lives. It is the distinction of our species, the seat of ourhumanity. Civilization is a product of the cerebral cortex.","1061":"The language of the brain is not the DNA language of the genes. Rather, what weknow is encoded in cells called neurons - microscopic electrochemical switching elements,typically a few hundredths of a millimeter across. Each of us has perhaps a hundred billionneurons, comparable to the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. Many neurons havethousands of connections with their neighbors. There are something like a hundred trillion,10 14 , such connections in the human cerebral cortex.","1062":"Charles Sherrington imagined the activities in the cerebral cortex upon awakening:","1063":"[The cortex] becomes now a sparkling field of rhythmic flashing points with trainsof traveling sparks hurrying hither and thither.

Our thoughts, visions andfantasies have a physical reality. A thought is made of hundreds of electrochemicalimpulses.

Another might be part of an anxious all-points bulletin:","1067":"\u2018Where did I leave the keys?\u2019","1068":"There are many valleys in the mountains of the mind, convolutions that greatlyincrease the surface area available in the cerebral cortex for information storage in a skullof limited size.

But there is no evidence that itsfunctioning is due to anything more than the 10 14 neural connections that build an elegantarchitecture of consciousness. The world of thought is divided roughly into twohemispheres. The right hemisphere of the cerebral cortex is mainly responsible for patternrecognition, intuition, sensitivity, creative insights. The left hemisphere presides overrational, analytical and critical thinking. These are the dual strengths, the essentialopposites, that characterize human thinking. Together, they provide the means both forgenerating ideas and for testing their validity. A continuous dialogue is going on betweenthe two hemispheres, channeled through an immense bundle of nerves, the corpus callosum,the bridge between creativity and analysis, both of which are necessary to understand theworld.","1069":"The information content of the human brain expressed in bits is probablycomparable to the total number of connections among the neurons - about a hundred trillion,10 14 , bits. If written out in English, say, that information would fill some twenty millionvolumes, as many as in the world's largest libraries. The equivalent of twenty million booksis inside the heads of every one us. The brain is a very big place in a very small space. Mostof the books in the brain are in the cerebral cortex. Down in the basement are the functionsour remote ancestors mainly depended on - aggression, child-rearing, fear, sex, thewillingness to follow leaders blindly. Of the higher brain functions, some - reading, writing,speaking - seem to be localized in particular places in the cerebral cortex. Memories, on theother hand, are stored redundantly in many locales. If such a thing as telepathy existed, oneof its glories would be the opportunity for each of us to read the books in the cerebralcortices of our loved ones. But there is no compelling evidence for telepathy, and thecommunication of such information remains the task of artists and writers.","1070":"The brain does much more than recollect. It compares, synthesizes, analyzes,generates abstractions. We must figure out much more than our genes can know. That iswhy the brain library is some ten thousand times larger than the gene library. Our passionfor learning, evident in the behavior of every toddler, is the tool for our survival. Emotionsand ritualized behavior patterns are built deeply into us. They are part of our humanity. Butthey are not characteristically human. Many other animals have feelings. What","1071":"distinguishes our species is thought. The cerebral cortex is a liberation. We need no longerbe trapped in the genetically inherited behavior patterns of lizards and baboons. We are,each of us, largely responsible for what gets put into our brains, for what, as adults, wewind up caring for and knowing about. No longer at the mercy of the reptile brain, we canchange ourselves.","1072":"Most of the world's great cities have grown haphazardly, little by little, in responseto the needs of the moment; very rarely is a city planned for the remote future. Theevolution of a city is like the evolution of the brain: it develops from a small center andslowly grows and changes, leaving many old parts still functioning. There is no way forevolution to rip out the ancient interior of the brain because of its imperfections and replaceit with something of more modern manufacture. The brain must function during therenovation. That is why the brainstem is surrounded by the R-complex, then the limbicsystem and finally the cerebral cortex. The old parts are in charge of too many fundamentalfunctions for them to be replaced altogether. So they wheeze along, out-of-date andsometimes counterproductive, but a necessary consequence of our evolution.","1073":"In New York City, the arrangement of many of the major streets dates to theseventeenth century, the stock exchange to the eighteenth century, the waterworks to thenineteenth, the electrical power system to the twentieth. The arrangement might be moreefficient if all civic systems were constructed in parallel and replaced periodically (which iswhy disastrous fires - the great conflagrations of London and Chicago, for example - aresometimes an aid in city planning). But the slow accretion of new functions permits the cityto work more or less continuously through the centuries. In the seventeenth century youtraveled between Brooklyn and Manhattan across the East River by ferry. In the nineteenthcentury, the technology became available to construct a suspension bridge across the river.It was built precisely at the site of the ferry terminal, both because the city owned the landand because major thoroughfares were already converging on the pre-existing ferry service.Later when it was possible to construct a tunnel under the river, it too was built in the sameplace for the same reasons, and also because small abandoned precursors of tunnels, calledcaissons, had already been emplaced during the construction of the bridge. This use andrestructuring of previous systems for new purposes is very much like the pattern ofbiological evolution.","1074":"When our genes could not store all the information necessary for survival, weslowly invented brains. But then the time came, perhaps ten thousand years ago, when weneeded to know more than could conveniently be contained in brains. So we learned tostockpile enormous quantities of information outside our bodies. We are the only specieson the planet, so far as we know, to have invented a communal memory stored neither inour genes nor in our brains. The warehouse of that memory is called the library.","1075":"A book is made from a tree. It is an assemblage of flat, flexible parts (still called\u2018leaves\u2019) imprinted with dark pigmented squiggles. One glance at it and you hear the voiceof another person - perhaps someone dead for thousands of years. Across the millennia, theauthor is speaking, clearly and silently, inside your head, directly to you. Writing is perhapsthe greatest of human inventions, binding together people, citizens of distant epochs, whonever knew one another. Books break the shackles of time, proof that humans can workmagic.","1076":"Some of the earliest authors wrote on clay. Cuneiform writing, the remote ancestorof the Western alphabet, was invented in the Near East about 5,000 years ago. Its purposewas to keep records: the purchase of grain, the sale of land, the triumphs of the king, thestatutes of the priests, the positions of the stars, the prayers to the gods. For thousands ofyears, writing was chiseled into clay and stone, scratched onto wax or bark or leather;painted on bamboo or papyrus or silk - but always one copy at a time and, except for theinscriptions on monuments, always for a tiny readership. Then in China between the secondand sixth centuries, paper, ink and printing with carved wooden blocks were all invented,permitting many copies of a work to be made and distributed. It took a thousand years forthe idea to catch on in remote and backward Europe. Then, suddenly, books were beingprinted all over the world. Just before the invention of movable type, around 1450, therewere no more than a few tens of thousands of books in all of Europe, all handwritten; aboutas many as in China in 100 B.C., and a tenth as many as in the Great Library of Alexandria.Fifty years later, around 1500, there were ten million printed books. Learning had becomeavailable to anyone who could read. Magic was everywhere.","1077":"More recently, books, especially paperbacks, have been printed in massive andinexpensive editions. For the price of a modest meal you can ponder the decline and fall ofthe Roman Empire, the origin of species, the interpretation of dreams, the nature of things.Books are like seeds. They can lie dormant for centuries and then flower in the mostunpromising soil.","1078":"The great libraries of the world contain millions of volumes, the equivalent of about10 14 bits of information in words, and perhaps 10 15 bits in pictures. This is ten thousandtimes more information than in our genes, and about ten times more than in our brains. If Ifinish a book a week, I will read only a few thousand books in my lifetime, about a tenth ofa percent of the contents of the greatest libraries of our time. The trick is to know whichbooks to read. The information in books is not preprogrammed at birth but constantlychanged, amended by events, adapted to the world. It is now twenty-three centuries sincethe founding of the Alexandrian Library. If there were no books, no written records, thinkhow prodigious a time twenty-three centuries would be. With four generations per century,twenty-three centuries occupies almost a hundred generations of human beings. Ifinformation could be passed on merely by word of mouth, how little we should know of ourpast, how slow would be our progress! Everything would depend on what ancient findingswe had accidentally been told about, and how accurate the account was. Past informationmight be revered, but in successive retellings it would become progressively more muddledand eventually lost. Books permit us to voyage through time, to tap the wisdom of ourancestors. The library connects us with the insights and knowledge, painfully extractedfrom Nature, of the greatest minds that ever were, with the best teachers, drawn from theentire planet and from all of our history, to instruct us without tiring, and to inspire us tomake our own contribution to the collective knowledge of the human species. Publiclibraries depend on voluntary contributions. I think the health of our civilization, the depthof our awareness about the underpinnings of our culture and our concern for the future canall be tested by how well we support our libraries.","1079":"Were the Earth to be started over again with all its physical features identical, it is","1080":"extremely unlikely that anything closely resembling a human being would ever againemerge. There is a powerful random character to the evolutionary process. A cosmic raystriking a different gene, producing a different mutation, can have small consequences earlybut profound consequences late. Happenstance may play a powerful role in biology, as itdoes in history. The farther back the critical events occur, the more powerfully can theyinfluence the present.","1081":"For example, consider our hands. We have five fingers, including one opposablethumb. They serve us quite well. But I think we would be served equally well with sixfingers including a thumb, or four fingers including a thumb, or maybe five fingers and twothumbs. There is nothing intrinsically best about our particular configuration of fingers,which we ordinarily think of as so natural and inevitable. We have five fingers because wehave descended from a Devonian fish that had five phalanges or bones in its fins. Had wedescended from a fish with four or six phalanges, we would have four or six fingers on eachhand and would think them perfectly natural. We use base ten arithmetic only because wehave ten fingers on our hands.* Had the arrangement been otherwise, we would use baseeight or base twelve arithmetic and relegate base ten to the New Math. The same pointapplies, I believe, to many more essential aspects of our being - our hereditary material, ourinternal biochemistry, our form, stature, organ systems, loves and hates, passions anddespairs, tenderness and aggression, even our analytical processes - all of these are, at leastin part, the result of apparently minor accidents in our immensely long evolutionary history.Perhaps if one less dragonfly had drowned in the Carboniferous swamps, the intelligentorganisms on our planet today would have feathers and teach their young in rookeries. Thepattern of evolutionary causality is a web of astonishing complexity; the incompleteness ofour understanding humbles us.","1082":"* The arithmetic based on the number 5 or 10 seems so obvious that the ancient Greek equivalent of\u2018to count\u2019 literally means \u2018to five.\u2019","1083":"Just sixty- five million years ago our ancestors were the most unprepossessing ofmammals - creatures with the size and intelligence of moles or tree shrews. It would havetake a very audacious biologist to guess that such animals would eventually produce theline that dominates the Earth today. The Earth then was full of awesome, nightmarishlizards - the dinosaurs, immensely successful creatures, which filled virtually everyecological niche. There were swimming reptiles, flying reptiles, and reptiles - some as tallas a six-story building - thundering across the face of the Earth. Some of them had ratherlarge brains, an upright posture and two little front legs very much like hands, which theyused to catch small, speedy mammals - probably including our distant ancestors - for dinner.If such dinosaurs had survived, perhaps the dominant intelligent species on our planet todaywould be four meters tall with green skin and sharp teeth, and the human form would beconsidered a lurid fantasy of saurian science fiction. But the dinosaurs did not survive. Inone catastrophic event all of them and many, perhaps most, of the other species on theEarth, were destroyed.* But not the tree shrews. Not the mammals. They survived.","1084":"* A recent analysis suggests that 96 per cent of all the species in the oceans may have died at this","1085":"time. With such an enormous extinction rate, the organisms of today can have evolved from only a small andunrepresentative sampling of the organisms that lived in late Mesozoic times.","1086":"No one knows what wiped out the dinosaurs. One evocative idea is that it was acosmic catastrophe, the explosion of a nearby star - a supernova like the one that producedthe Crab Nebula. If there were by chance a supernova within ten or twenty light-years ofthe solar system some sixty-five million years ago, it would have sprayed an intense flux ofcosmic rays into space, and some of these, entering the Earth's envelope of air, would haveburned the atmospheric nitrogen. The oxides of nitrogen thus generated would haveremoved the protective layer of ozone from the atmosphere, increasing the flux of solarultraviolet radiation at the surface and frying and mutating the many organisms imperfectlyprotected against intense ultraviolet light. Some of those organisms may have been staplesof the dinosaur diet.","1087":"The disaster, whatever it was, that cleared the dinosaurs from the world stageremoved the pressure on the mammals. Our ancestors no longer had to live in the shadowof voracious reptiles. We diversified exuberantly and flourished. Twenty million years ago,our immediate ancestors probably still lived in the trees, later descending because theforests receded during a major ice age and were replaced by grassy savannahs. It is notmuch good to be supremely adapted to life in the trees if there are very few trees. Manyarboreal primates must have vanished with the forests. A few eked out a precariousexistence on the ground and survived. And one of those lines evolved to become us. No oneknows the cause of that climatic change. It may have been a small variation in the intrinsicluminosity of the Sun or in the orbit of the Earth; or massive volcanic eruptions injectingfine dust into the stratosphere, reflecting more sunlight back into space and cooling theEarth. It may have been due to changes in the general circulation of the oceans. Or perhapsthe passage of the Sun through a galactic dust cloud. Whatever the cause, we see again howtied our existence is to random astronomical and geological events.","1088":"After we came down from the trees, we evolved an upright posture; our hands werefree; we possessed excellent binocular vision - we had acquired many of the preconditionsfor making tools. There was now a real advantage in possessing a large brain and incommunicating complex thoughts. Other things being equal, it is better to be smart than tobe stupid. Intelligent beings can solve problems better, live longer and leave moreoffspring; until the invention of nuclear weapons, intelligence powerfully aided survival. Inour history it was some horde of furry little mammals who hid from the dinosaurs,colonized the treetops and later scampered down to domesticate fire, invent writing,construct observatories and launch space vehicles. If things had been a little different, itmight have been some other creature whose intelligence and manipulative ability wouldhave led to comparable accomplishments. Perhaps the smart bipedal dinosaurs, or theraccoons, or the otters, or the squid. It would be nice to know how different otherintelligences can be; so we study the whales and the great apes. To learn a little about whatother kinds of civilizations are possible, we can study history and cultural anthropology.","1089":"But we are all of us - us whales, us apes, us people - too closely related. As long as ourinquiries are limited to one or two evolutionary lines on a single planet, we will remainforever ignorant of the possible range and brilliance of other intelligences and other","1090":"civilizations.","1091":"On another planet, with a different sequence of random processes to makehereditary diversity and a different environment to select particular combinations of genes,the chances of finding beings who are physically very similar to us is, I believe, near zero.The chances of finding another form of intelligence is not. Their brains may well haveevolved from the inside out. They may have switching elements analogous to our neurons.But the neurons may be very different; perhaps superconductors that work at very lowtemperatures rather than organic devices that work at room temperature, in which case theirspeed of thought will be 10 times faster than ours. Or perhaps the equivalent of neuronselsewhere would not be in direct physical contact but in radio communication so that asingle intelligent being could be distributed among many different organisms, or even manydifferent planets, each with a part of the intelligence of the whole, each contributing byradio to an intelligence much greater than itself.* There may be planets where theintelligent beings have about 10 14 neural connections, as we do. But there may be placeswhere the number is 10 24 or 10 34 . 1 wonder what they would know. Because we inhabit thesame universe as they, we and they must share some substantial information in common. Ifwe could make contact, there is much in their brains that would be of great interest to ours.But the opposite is also true. I think extraterrestrial intelligence - even beings substantiallyfurther evolved than we - will be interested in us, in what we know, how we think, what ourbrains are like, the course of our evolution, the prospects for our future.","1092":"* In some sense such a radio integration of separate individuals is already beginning to happen on theplanet Earth.","1093":"If there are intelligent beings on the planets of fairly nearby stars, could they knowabout us? Might they somehow have an inkling of the long evolutionary progression fromgenes to brains to libraries that has occurred on the obscure planet Earth? If theextraterrestrials stay at home, there are at least two ways in which they might find out aboutus. One way would be to listen with large radio telescopes. For billions of years they wouldhave heard only weak and intermittent radio static caused by lightning and the trappedelectrons and protons whistling within the Earth's magnetic field. Then, less than a centuryago, the radio waves leaving the Earth would become stronger, louder, less like noise andmore like signals. The inhabitants of Earth had finally stumbled upon radio communication.Today there is a vast international radio, television and radar communications traffic. Atsome radio frequencies the Earth has become by far the brightest object, the most powerfulradio source, in the solar system - brighter than Jupiter, brighter than the Sun. Anextraterrestrial civilization monitoring the radio emission from Earth and receiving suchsignals could not fail to conclude that something interesting had been happening herelately.","1094":"As the Earth rotates, our more powerful radio transmitters slowly sweep the sky. Aradio astronomer on a planet of another star would be able to calculate the length of the dayon Earth from the times of appearance and disappearance of our signals. Some of our mostpowerful sources are radar transmitters; a few are used for radar astronomy, to probe withradio fingers the surfaces of the nearby planets. The size of the radar beam projected","1095":"against the sky is much larger than the size of the planets, and much of the signal wafts on,out of the solar system into the depths of interstellar space to any sensitive receivers thatmay be listening. Most radar transmissions are for military purposes; they scan the skies inconstant fear of a massive launch of missiles with nuclear warheads, an augury fifteenminutes early of the end of human civilization. The information content of these pulses isnegligible: a succession of simple numerical patterns coded into beeps.","1096":"Overall, the most pervasive and noticeable source of radio transmissions from theEarth is our television programming. Because the Earth is turning, some television stationswill appear at one horizon of the Earth while others disappear over the other. There will bea confused jumble of programs. Even these might be sorted out and pieced together by anadvanced civilization on a planet of a nearby star. The most frequently repeated messageswill be station call signals and appeals to purchase detergents, deodorants, headache tablets,and automobile and petroleum products. The most noticeable messages will be thosebroadcast simultaneously by many transmitters in many time zones - for example, speechesin times of international crisis by the President of the United States or the Premier of theSoviet Union. The mindless contents of commercial television and the integuments ofinternational crisis and internecine warfare within the human family are the principalmessages about life on Earth that we choose to broadcast to the Cosmos. What must theythink of us?","1097":"There is no calling those television programs back. There is no way of sending afaster message to overtake them and revise the previous transmission. Nothing can travelfaster than light. Large-scale television transmission on the planet Earth began only in thelate 1940\u2019s. Thus, there is a spherical wave front centered on the Earth expanding at thespeed of light and containing Howdy Doody, the \u2018Checkers\u2019 speech of then Vice-PresidentRichard M. Nixon and the televised inquisitions by Senator Joseph McCarthy. Becausethese transmissions were broadcast a few decades ago, they are only a few tens oflight-years away from the Earth. If the nearest civilization is farther away than that, then wecan continue to breathe easy for a while. In any case, we can hope that they will find theseprograms incomprehensible.","1098":"The two Voyager spacecraft are bound for the stars. Affixed to each is a gold-platedcopper phonograph record with a cartridge and stylus and, on the aluminum record jacket,instructions for use. We sent something about our genes, something about our brains, andsomething about our libraries to other beings who might sail the sea of interstellar space.But we did not want to send primarily scientific information. Any civilization able tointercept Voyager in the depths of interstellar space, its transmitters long dead, would knowfar more science than we do. Instead, we wanted to tell those other beings something aboutwhat seems unique about ourselves. The interests of the cerebral cortex and limbic systemare well represented; the R-complex less so. Although the recipients may not know anylanguages of the Earth, we included greetings in sixty human tongues, as well as the hellosof the humpback whales. We sent photographs of humans from all over the world caringfor one another, learning, fabricating tools and art and responding to challenges. There is anhour and a half of exquisite music from many cultures, some of it expressing our sense ofcosmic loneliness, our wish to end our isolation, our longing to make contact with otherbeings in the Cosmos. And we have sent recordings of the sounds that would have been","1099":"heard on our planet from the earliest days before the origin of life to the evolution of thehuman species and our most recent burgeoning technology. It is, as much as the sounds ofany baleen whale, a love song cast upon the vastness of the deep. Many, perhaps most, ofour messages will be indecipherable. But we have sent them because it is important to try.","1100":"In this spirit we included on the Voyager spacecraft the thoughts and feelings of oneperson, the electrical activity of her brain, heart, eyes and muscles, which were recorded foran hour, transcribed into sound, compressed in time and incorporated into the record. In onesense we have launched into the Cosmos a direct transcription of the thoughts and feelingsof a single human being in the month of June in the year 1977 on the planet Earth. Perhapsthe recipients will make nothing of it, or think it is a recording of a pulsar, which in somesuperficial sense it resembles. Or perhaps a civilization unimaginably more advanced thanours will be able to decipher such recorded thoughts and feelings and appreciate our effortsto share ourselves with them.","1101":"The information in our genes is very old - most of it more than millions of years old,some of it billions of years old. In contrast, the information in our books is at mostthousands of years old, and that in our brains is only decades old. The long-livedinformation is not the characteristically human information. Because of erosion on theEarth, our monuments and artifacts will not, in the natural course of things, survive to thedistant future. But the Voyager record is on its way out of the solar system. The erosion ininterstellar space - chiefly cosmic rays and impacting dust grains - is so slow that theinformation on the record will last a billion years. Genes and brains and books encodeinformation differently and persist through time at different rates. But the persistence of thememory of the human species will be far longer in the impressed metal grooves on theVoyager interstellar record.","1102":"The Voyager message is traveling with agonizing slowness. The fastest object everlaunched by the human species, it will still take tens of thousands of years to go thedistance to the nearest star. Any television program will traverse in hours the distance thatVoyager has covered in years. A television transmission that has just finished being airedwill, in only a few hours, overtake the Voyager spacecraft in the region of Saturn andbeyond and speed outward to the stars. If it is headed that way, the signal will reach AlphaCentauri in a little more than four years. If, some decades or centuries hence, anyone outthere in space hears our television broadcasts, I hope they will think well of us, a product offifteen billion years of cosmic evolution, the local transmogrification of matter intoconsciousness. Our intelligence has recently provided us with awesome powers. It is not yetclear that we have the wisdom to avoid our own self-destruction. But many of us are tryingvery hard. We hope that very soon in the perspective of cosmic time we will have unifiedour planet peacefully into an organization cherishing the life of every living creature on itand will be ready to take that next great step, to become part of a galactic society ofcommunicating civilizations.","1103":"Encyclopaedia Galactica","1104":"\u2018What are you?

While inspecting the schools in his province, Fourier discovered aneleven-year-old boy whose remarkable intellect and flair for oriental languages had alreadyearned him the admiring attention of scholars. Fourier invited him home for a chat. The boywas fascinated by Fourier\u2019s collection of Egyptian artifacts, collected during theNapoleonic expedition where he had been responsible for cataloging the astronomicalmonuments of that ancient civilization. The hieroglyphic inscriptions roused the boy\u2019ssense of wonder. \u2018But what do they mean?\u2019 he asked. \u2018Nobody knows,\u2019 was the reply. Theboy\u2019s name was Jean Fran\u00a3ois Champollion. Fired by the mystery of language no one couldread, he became a superb linguist and passionately immersed himself in ancient Egyptianwriting. France at that time was flooded with Egyptian artifacts, stolen by Napoleon andlater made available to Western scholars. The description of the expedition was published,and devoured by the young Champollion. As an adult, Champollion succeeded; fulfillinghis childhood ambition, he provided a brilliant decipherment of the ancient Egyptianhieroglyphics. But it was not until 1828, twenty-seven years after his meeting with Fourier,that Champollion first set foot in Egypt, the land of his dreams, and sailed upstream fromCairo, following the course of the Nile, paying homage to the culture he had worked sohard to understand. It was an expedition in time, a visit to an alien civilization:","1119":"The evening of the 1 6th we finally arrived at Dendera.

Many before himhad tried and failed to decipher the lovely hieroglyphics, a word that means \u2018sacredcarvings.\u2019 Some scholars had believed them to be a kind of picture code, rich in murkymetaphor, mostly about eyeballs and wavy lines, beetles, bumblebees and birds - especiallybirds. Confusion was rampant. There were those who deduced that the Egyptians werecolonists from ancient China. There were those who concluded the opposite. Enormousfolio volumes of spurious translations were published. One interpreter glanced at theRosetta stone, whose hieroglyphic inscription was then still undeciphered, and instantlyannounced its meaning. He said that the quick decipherment enabled him \u2018to avoid thesystematic errors which invariably arise from prolonged reflection.\u2019 You get better results,he argued, by not thinking too much.

Instead, withthe aid of a brilliant insight by the English physicist Thomas Young, he proceededsomething like this: The Rosetta stone had been uncovered in 1799 by a French soldierworking on the fortifications of the Nile Delta town of Rashid, which the Europeans,largely ignorant of Arabic, called Rosetta. It was a slab from an ancient temple, displayingwhat seemed clearly to be the same message in three different writings: in hieroglyphics attop, in a kind of cursive hieroglyphic called demotic in the middle, and, the key to theenterprise, in Greek at the bottom. Champollion, who was fluent in ancient Greek, read thatthe stone had been inscribed to commemorate the coronation of Ptolemy V Epiphanes, inthe spring of the year 196 B.C. On this occasion the king released political prisoners,remitted taxes, endowed temples, forgave rebels, increased military preparedness and, inshort, did all the things that modern rulers do when they wish to stay in office.","1124":"The Greek text mentions Ptolemy many times. In roughly the same positions in thehieroglyphic text is a set of symbols surrounded by an oval or cartouche. This,","1125":"Champollion reasoned, very probably also denotes Ptolemy. If so, the writing could not befundamentally pictographic or metaphorical; rather, most of the symbols must stand for","1126":"letters or syllables. Champollion also had the presence of mind to count up the number ofGreek words and the number of individual hieroglyphs in what were presumably equivalenttexts. There were many fewer of the former, again suggesting that the hieroglyphs weremainly letters and syllables. But which hieroglyphs correspond to which letters?Fortunately, Champollion had available to him an obelisk, which had been excavated atPhilae, that included the hieroglyphic equivalent of the Greek name Cleopatra. Ptolemybegins with P; the first symbol in the cartouche is a square. Cleopatra has for its fifth lettera P, and in the Cleopatra cartouche in the fifth position is the same square. P it is. Thefourth letter in Ptolemy is an L. It is represented by the lion. The second letter of Cleopatrais an L and, in hieroglyphics, here is a lion again. The eagle is an A, appearing twice inCleopatra, as it should. A clear pattern is emerging. Egyptian hieroglyphics are, insignificant part, a simple substitution cipher. But not every hieroglyph is a letter or syllable.Some are pictographs. The end of the Ptolemy cartouche means \u2018Ever-living, beloved ofthe god Ptah.\u2019 The semicircle and egg at the end of Cleopatra are a conventional ideogramfor \u2018daughter of Isis.\u2019 This mix of letters and pictographs caused some grief for earlierinterpreters.","1127":"In retrospect it sounds almost easy. But it had taken many centuries to figure out,and there was a great deal more to do, especially in the decipherment of the hieroglyphs ofmuch earlier times. The cartouches were the key within the key, almost as if the pharaohsof Egypt had circled their own names to make the going easier for the Egyptologists twothousand years in the future. Champollion walked the Great Hypostyle Hall at Karnak andcasually read the inscriptions, which had mystified everyone else, answering the questionhe had posed as a child to Fourier. What a joy it must have been to open this one-waycommunication channel with another civilization, to permit a culture that had been mute formillennia to speak of its history, magic, medicine, religion, politics and philosophy.","1128":"Today we are again seeking messages from an ancient and exotic civilization, thistime hidden from us not only in time but also in space. If we should receive a radiomessage from an extraterrestrial civilization, how could it possibly be understood?Extraterrestrial intelligence will be elegant, complex, internally consistent and utterly alien.Extraterrestrials would, of course, wish to make a message sent to us as comprehensible aspossible. But how could they? Is there in any sense an interstellar Rosetta stone? Webelieve there is. We believe there is a common language that all technical civilizations, nomatter how different, must have. That common language is science and mathematics. Thelaws of Nature are the same everywhere. The patterns in the spectra of distant stars andgalaxies are the same as those for the Sun or for appropriate laboratory experiments: notonly do the same chemical elements exist everywhere in the universe, but also the samelaws of quantum mechanics that govern the absorption and emission of radiation by atomsapply everywhere as well. Distant galaxies revolving about one another follow the samelaws of gravitational physics as govern the motion of an apple falling to Earth, or Voyageron its way to the stars. The patterns of Nature are everywhere the same. An interstellarmessage, intended to be understood by an emerging civilization; should be easy to decode.","1129":"We do not expect an advanced technical civilization on any other planet in our solarsystem. If one were only a little behind us - 10,000 years, say - it would have no advancedtechnology at all. If it were only a little ahead of us - we who are already exploring the solar","1130":"system - its representatives should by now be here. To communicate with othercivilizations, we require a method adequate not merely for interplanetary distances but forinterstellar distances. Ideally, the method should be inexpensive, so that a huge amount ofinformation could be sent and received at very little cost; fast, so an interstellar dialogue isrendered possible; and obvious, so any technological civilization, no matter what itsevolutionary path, will discover it early. Surprisingly, there is such a method. It is calledradio astronomy.","1131":"The largest semi-steerable radio\/radar observatory on the planet Earth is the Arecibofacility, which Cornell University operates for the National Science Foundation. In theremote hinterland of the island of Puerto Rico, it is 305 meters (a thousand feet) across, itsreflecting surface a section of a sphere laid down in a pre-existing bowl-shaped valley. Itreceives radio waves from the depths of space, focusing them onto the feed arm antennahigh above the dish, which is in turn electronically connected to the control room, wherethe signal is analyzed. Alternatively, when the telescope is used as a radar transmitter, thefeed arm can broadcast a signal into the dish, which reflects it into space. The AreciboObservatory has been used both to search for intelligent signals from civilizations in spaceand, just once, to broadcast a message - to Ml 3, a distant globular cluster of stars, so thatour technical capability to engage in both sides of an interstellar dialogue would be clear, atleast to us.","1132":"In a period of a few weeks, the Arecibo Observatory could transmit to a comparableobservatory on a planet of a nearby star all of the Encyclopaedia Britannica. Radio wavestravel at the speed of light, 10,000 times faster than a message attached to our fastestinterstellar spaceship. Radio telescopes generate, in narrow frequency ranges, signals sointense they can be detected over immense interstellar distances. The Arecibo Observatorycould communicate with an identical radio telescope on a planet 15,000 light-years away,halfway to the center of the Milky Way Galaxy, if we knew precisely where to point it. Andradio astronomy is a natural technology. Virtually any planetary atmosphere, no matterwhat its composition, should be partially transparent to radio waves. Radio messages arenot much absorbed or scattered by the gas between the stars, just as a San Francisco radiostation can be heard easily in Fos Angeles even when smog there has reduced the visibilityat optical wavelengths to a few kilometers. There are many natural cosmic radio sourceshaving nothing to do with intelligent life - pulsars and quasars, the radiation belts of planetsand the outer atmospheres of stars; from almost any planet there are bright radio sources todiscover early in the local development of radio astronomy. Moreover, radio represents alarge fraction of the electromagnetic spectrum. Any technology able to detect radiation ofany wavelength would fairly soon stumble on the radio part of the spectrum.","1133":"There may be other effective methods of communication that have substantial merit:interstellar spacecraft; optical or infrared lasers; pulsed neutrinos; modulated gravitywaves; or some other kind of transmission that we will not discover for a thousand years.Advanced civilizations may have graduated far beyond radio for their own communications.But radio is powerful, cheap, fast and simple. They will know that a backward civilizationlike ours,, wishing to receive messages from the skies, is likely to turn first to radiotechnology. Perhaps they will have to wheel the radio telescopes out of the Museum ofAncient Technology. If we were to receive a radio message we would know that there","1134":"would be at the very least one thing we could talk about: radio astronomy.","1135":"But is there anyone out there to talk to? With a third or half a trillion stars in ourMilky Way Galaxy alone, could ours be the only one accompanied by an inhabited planet?How much more likely it is that technical civilizations are a cosmic commonplace, that theGalaxy is pulsing and humming with advanced societies, and, therefore, that the nearestsuch culture is not so very far away - perhaps transmitting from antennas established on aplanet of a naked-eye star just next door. Perhaps when we look up at the sky at night, nearone of those faint pinpoints of light is a world on which someone quite different from us isthen glancing idly at a star we call the Sun and entertaining, for just a moment, anoutrageous speculation.","1136":"It is very hard to be sure. There may be severe impediments to the evolution of atechnical civilization. Planets may be rarer than we think. Perhaps the origin of life is not soeasy as our laboratory experiments suggest. Perhaps the evolution of advanced life forms isimprobable. Or it may be that complex life forms evolve readily, but intelligence andtechnical societies require an unlikely set of coincidences - just as the evolution of thehuman species depended on the demise of the dinosaurs and the ice-age recession of theforests in whose trees our ancestors screeched and dimly wondered. Or perhapscivilizations arise repeatedly, inexorably, on innumerable planets in the Milky Way, but aregenerally unstable; so all but a tiny fraction are unable to survive their technology andsuccumb to greed and ignorance, pollution and nuclear war.","1137":"It is possible to explore this great issue further and make a crude estimate of N, thenumber of advanced technical civilizations in the Galaxy. We define an advancedcivilization as one capable of radio astronomy. This is, of course, a parochial if essentialdefinition. There may be countless worlds on which the inhabitants are accomplishedlinguists or superb poets but indifferent radio astronomers. We will not hear from them. Ncan be written as the product or multiplication of a number of factors, each a kind of filter,every one of which must be sizable for there to be large number of civilizations:","1138":"N*, the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy;f p , the fraction of stars that have planetary systems;","1139":"n e , the number of planets in a given system that are ecologically suitable for life;fi, the fraction of otherwise suitable planets on which life actually arises;fi, the fraction of inhabited planets on which an intelligent form of life evolves;f c , the fraction of planets inhabited by intelligent beings on which a communicativetechnical civilization develops; and","1140":"fL, the fraction of a planetary lifetime graced by a technical civilization.","1141":"Written out, the equation reads N = NT p n c f|fjf c f[. All the f\u2019s are fractions, having valuesbetween 0 and 1 ; they will pare down the large value of N*.","1142":"To derive N we must estimate each of these quantities. We know a fair amount about theearly factors in the equation, the numbers of stars and planetary systems. We know verylittle about the later factors, concerning the evolution of intelligence or the lifetime of","1143":"technical societies. In these cases our estimates will be little better than guesses. I inviteyou, if you disagree with my estimates below, to make your own choices and see whatimplications your alternative suggestions have for the number of advanced civilizations inthe Galaxy. One of the great virtues of this equation, due originally to Frank Drake ofCornell, is that it involves subjects ranging from stellar and planetary astronomy to organicchemistry, evolutionary biology, history, politics and abnormal psychology. Much of theCosmos is in the span of the Drake equation.","1144":"We know N*, the number of stars in the Milky Way Galaxy, fairly well, by carefulcounts of stars in small but representative regions of the sky. It is a few hundred billion;some recent estimates place it at 4x 10 11 . Very few of these stars are of the massiveshort-lived variety that squander their reserves of thermonuclear fuel. The great majorityhave lifetimes of billions or more years in which they are shining stably, providing asuitable energy source for the origin and evolution of life on nearby planets.","1145":"There is evidence that planets are a frequent accompaniment of star formation: inthe satellite systems of Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus, which are like miniature solar systems;in theories of the origin of the planets; in studies of double stars; in observations ofaccretion disks around stars; and in some preliminary investigations of gravitationalperturbations of nearby stars. Many, perhaps even most, stars may have planets. We takethe fraction of stars that have planets, f p , as roughly equal to 1\/3 . Then the total number ofplanetary systems in the Galaxy would be N*f p ~ 1.3 x 10 11 (the symbol ~ means\u2018approximately equal to\u2019). If each system were to have about ten planets, as ours does, thetotal number of worlds in the Galaxy would be more than a trillion, a vast arena for thecosmic drama.","1146":"In our own solar system there are several bodies that may be suitable for life ofsome sort: the Earth certainly, and perhaps Mars, Titan and Jupiter. Once life originates, ittends to be very adaptable and tenacious. There must be many different environmentssuitable for life in a given planetary system. But conservatively we choose n e = 2. Then thenumber of planets in the Galaxy suitable for life becomes N*f p n e ~ 3 x 10 11 .","1147":"Experiments show that under the most common cosmic conditions the molecularbasis of life is readily made, the building blocks of molecules able to make copies ofthemselves. We are now on less certain ground; there may, for example, be impediments inthe evolution of the genetic code, although I think this unlikely over billions of years ofprimeval chemistry. We choose 1) ~ 1\/3, implying a total number of planets in the MilkyWay on which life has arisen at least once as N*f p n e fi =lxl 0 1 1 , a hundred billion inhabitedworlds. That in itself is a remarkable conclusion. But we are not yet finished.","1148":"The choices of f, and f c are more difficult. On the one hand, many individuallyunlikely steps had to occur in biological evolution and human history for our presentintelligence and technology to develop. On the other hand, there must be many quitedifferent pathways to an advanced civilization of specified capabilities. Considering theapparent difficulty in the evolution of large organisms represented by the Cambrianexplosion, let us choose f;x f c = 1\/100, meaning that only 1 percent of planets on which lifearises eventually produce a technical civilization. This estimate represents some middleground among the varying scientific opinions. Some think that the equivalent of the step","1149":"from the emergence of trilobites to the domestication of fire goes like a shot in all planetarysystems; others think that, even given ten or fifteen billion years, the evolution of technicalcivilizations is unlikely. This is not a subject on which we can do much experimentation aslong as our investigations are limited to a single planet. Multiplying these factors together,we find N*f p n e fifif c =lxl O 9 , a billion planets on which technical civilizations have arisenat least once. But that is very different from saying that there are a billion planets on whichtechnical civilizations now exist. For this, we must also estimate fL.","1150":"What percentage of the lifetime of a planet is marked by a technical civilization?The Earth has harbored a technical civilization characterized by radio astronomy for only afew decades out of a lifetime of a few billion years. So far, then, for our planet fL, is less","1151":"o","1152":"than 1\/10 , a millionth of a percent. And it is hardly out of the question that we mightdestroy ourselves tomorrow. Suppose this were to be a typical case, and the destruction socomplete that no other technical civilization - of the human or any other species - were ableto emerge in the five or so billion years remaining before the Sun dies. Then N =N*f p n e fifif c fL = 10, and at any given time there would be only a tiny smattering, a handful, apitiful few technical civilizations in the Galaxy, the steady state number maintained asemerging societies replace those recently self-immolated. The number N might even be assmall as 1. If civilizations tend to destroy themselves soon after reaching a technologicalphase, there might be no one for us to talk with but ourselves. And that we do but poorly.Civilizations would take billions of years of tortuous evolution to arise, and then snuffthemselves out in an instant of unforgivable neglect.","1153":"But consider the alternative, the prospect that at least some civilizations learn to livewith high technology; that the contradictions posed by the vagaries of past brain evolutionare consciously resolved and do not lead to self-destruction; or that, even if majordisturbances do occur, they are reversed in the subsequent billions of years of biologicalevolution. Such societies might live to a prosperous old age, their lifetimes measuredperhaps on geological or stellar evolutionary time scales. If 1 percent of civilizations cansurvive technological adolescence, take the proper fork at this critical historical branch","1154":"n","1155":"point and achieve maturity, then f L ~ 1\/100, N ~ 1 0 , and the number of extant civilizationsin the Galaxy is in the millions. Thus, for all our concern about the possible unreliability ofour estimates of the early factors in the Drake equation, which involved astronomy, organicchemistry and evolutionary biology, the principal uncertainty comes down to economicsand politics and what, on Earth, we call human nature. It seems fairly clear that ifself-destruction is not the overwhelmingly preponderant fate of galactic civilizations, thenthe sky is softly humming with messages from the stars.","1156":"These estimates are stirring. They suggest that the receipt of a message from spaceis, even before we decode it, a profoundly hopeful sign. It means that someone has learnedto live with high technology; that it is possible to survive technological adolescence. Thisalone, quite apart from the contents of the message, provides a powerful justification for thesearch for other civilizations.","1157":"If there are millions of civilizations distributed more or less randomly through theGalaxy, the distance to the nearest is about two hundred light-years. Even at the speed oflight it would take two centuries for a radio message to get from there to here. If we had","1158":"initiated the dialogue, it would be as if the question had been asked by Johannes Kepler andthe answer received by us. Especially because we, new to radio astronomy, must becomparatively backward, and the transmitting civilization advanced, it makes more sensefor us to listen than to send. For a more advanced civilization, the positions are, of course,reversed.","1159":"We are at the earliest stages of our radio search for other civilizations in space. In anoptical photograph of a dense star field, there are hundreds of thousands of stars. By ourmore optimistic estimates, one of them is the site of an advanced civilization. But whichone? Toward which stars should we point our radio telescopes? Of the millions of stars thatmay mark the location of advanced civilizations, we have so far examined by radio no morethan thousands. We have made about one-tenth of one percent of the required effort. But aserious, rigorous, systematic search will come soon. The preparatory steps are nowunderway, both in the United States and in the Soviet Union. It is comparativelyinexpensive: the cost of a single naval vessel of intermediate size - a modern destroyer, say- would pay for a decade-long program in the search for extraterrestrial intelligence.","1160":"Benevolent encounters have not been the rule in human history, where transculturalcontacts have been direct and physical, quite different from the receipt of a radio signal, acontact as light as a kiss. Still, it is instructive to examine one or two cases from our past, ifonly to calibrate our expectations: Between the times of the American and the FrenchRevolutions, Fouis XVI of France outfitted an expedition to the Pacific Ocean, a voyagewith scientific, geographic, economic and nationalistic objectives. The commander was theCount of Fa Perouse, a noted explorer who had fought for the United States in its War ofIndependence. In July 1786, almost a year after setting sail, he reached the coast of Alaska,a place now called Fituya Bay. He was delighted with the harbor and wrote: \u2018Not a port inthe universe could afford more conveniences.\u2019 In this exemplary location, Fa Perouse","1161":"perceived some savages, who made signs of friendship, by displaying and wavingwhite mantles, and different skins. Several of the canoes of these Indians werefishing in the Bay . . . [We were] continually surrounded by the canoes of thesavages, who offered us fish, skins of otters and other animals, and different littlearticles of their dress in exchange for our iron. To our great surprise, they appearedwell accustomed to traffic, and bargained with us with as much skill as anytradesman of Europe.","1162":"The Native Americans drove increasingly harder bargains. To Fa Perouse\u2019 s annoyance,they also resorted to pilferage, largely of iron objects, but once of the uniforms of Frenchnaval officers hidden under their pillows as they were sleeping one night surrounded byarmed guards - a feat worthy of Harry Houdini. Fa Perouse followed his royal orders tobehave peaceably but complained that the natives \u2018believed our forbearance inexhaustible.\u2019He was disdainful of their society. But no serious damage was done by either culture to theother. After reprovisioning his two ships Fa Perouse sailed out of Fituya Bay, never toreturn. The expedition was lost in the South Pacific in 1788; Fa Perouse and all but one ofthe members of his crew perished.*","1163":"* When La Perouse was mustering the ship\u2019s company in France, there were many bright and eageryoung men who applied but were turned down. One of them was a Corsican artillery officer named NapoleonBonaparte. It was an interesting branch point in the history of the world. If La Perouse had acceptedBonaparte, the Rosetta stone might never have been found, Champollion might never have decryptedEgyptian hieroglyphics, and in many more important respects our recent history might have been changedsignificantly.","1164":"Exactly a century later Cowee, a chief of the Tlingit, related to the Canadiananthropologist G. T. Emmons a story of the first meeting of his ancestors with the whiteman, a narrative handed down by word of mouth only. The Tlingit possessed no writtenrecords, nor had Cowee ever heard of La Perouse. This is a paraphrase of Cowee\u2019s story:","1165":"Late one spring a large party of Tlingit ventured North to Yakutat to trade forcopper. Iron was even more precious, but it was unobtainable. In entering LituyaBay four canoes were swallowed by the waves. As the survivors made camp andmourned for their lost companions two strange objects entered the Bay. No oneknew what they were. They seemed to be great black birds with immense whitewings. The Tlingit believed the world had been created by a great bird which oftenassumed the form of a raven, a bird which had freed the Sun, the Moon, and thestars from boxes in which they had been imprisoned. To look upon the Raven wasto be turned to stone. In their fright, the Tlingit fled into the forest and hid. But aftera while, finding that no harm had come to them, a few more enterprising souls creptout and rolled leaves of the skunk cabbage into crude telescopes, believing that thiswould prevent being turned to stone. Through the skunk cabbage, it seemed that thegreat birds were folding their wings and that flocks of small black messengers arosefrom their bodies and crawled upon their feathers.","1166":"Now one nearly blind old warrior gathered the people together andannounced that his life was far behind him; for the common good he woulddetermine whether the Raven would turn his children into stone. Putting on his robeof sea otter fur, he entered his canoe and was paddled seaward to the Raven. Heclimbed upon it and heard strange voices. With his impaired vision he could barelymake out the many black forms moving before him. Perhaps they were crows.","1167":"When he returned safely to his people they crowded about him, surprised to see himalive. They touched him and smelled him to see if it was really he. After muchthought the old man convinced himself that it was not the god-raven that he hadvisited, but rather a giant Canoe made by men. The black figures were not crows butpeople of a different sort. He convinced the Tlingit, who then visited the ships andexchanged their furs for many strange articles, chiefly iron.","1168":"The Tlingit had preserved in oral tradition an entirely recognizable and accurate account oftheir first, almost fully peaceable encounter with an alien culture.*","1169":"* The account of Cowee, the Tlingit chief, shows that even in a preliterate culture a recognizableaccount of contact with an advanced civilization can be preserved for generations. If the Earth had been","1170":"visited hundreds or thousands of years ago by an advanced extraterrestrial civilization, even if the contactedculture was preliterate, we might well expect to have some recognizable form of the encounter preserved. Butthere is not a single case in which a legend reliably dated from earlier pretechnological times can beunderstood only in terms of contact with an extraterrestrial civilization.","1171":"If someday we make contact with a more advanced extraterrestrial civilization, willthe encounter be largely peaceable, even if lacking a certain rapport, like that of the Frenchamong the Tlingit, or will it follow some more ghastly prototype, where the society thatwas a little more advanced utterly destroyed the society that was technically morebackward? In the early sixteenth century a high civilization flourished in central Mexico.The Aztecs had monumental architecture, elaborate record-keeping, exquisite art and anastronomical calendar superior to that of any in Europe. Upon viewing the Aztec artifactsreturned by the first Mexican treasure ships, the artist Albrecht Diirer wrote in August1520: \u2018I have never seen anything heretofore that has so rejoiced my heart. I have seen . . .a sun entirely of gold a whole fathom broad fin fact, the Aztec astronomical calendar];likewise a moon entirely of silver, equally large . . . also two chambers full of all sorts ofweapons, armor, and other wonderous arms, all of which is fairer to see than marvels.\u2019Intellectuals were stunned at the Aztec books, \u2018which,\u2019 one of them said, \u2018almost resemblethose of the Egyptians.\u2019 Hernan Cortes described their capital Tenochtitlan as \u2018one of themost beautiful cities in the world . . . The people\u2019s activities and behavior are on almost ashigh a level as in Spain, and as well-organized and orderly. Considering that these peopleare barbarous, lacking knowledge of God and communication with other civilized nations,it is remarkable to see all that they have.\u2019 Two years after writing these words, Cortesutterly destroyed Tenochtitlan along with the rest of the Aztec civilization. Here is an Aztecaccount:","1172":"Moctezuma [the Aztec Emperor] was shocked, terrified by what he heard. He wasmuch puzzled by their food, but what made him almost faint away was the telling ofhow the great Lombard gun, at the Spaniards\u2019 command, expelled the shot whichthundered as it went off. The noise weakened one, dizzied one. Something like astone came out of it in a shower of fire and sparks. The smoke was foul; it had asickening, fetid smell. And the shot, which struck a mountain, knocked it to bits -dissolved it. It reduced a tree to sawdust - the tree disappeared as if they had blownit away . . . When Moctezuma was told all this, he was terror-struck. He felt faint.","1173":"His heart failed him.","1174":"Reports continued to arrive: \u2018We, are not as strong as they,\u2019 Moctezuma was told.\u2018We are nothing compared to them: The Spaniards began to be called \u2018the Gods come fromthe Heavens.\u2019 Nevertheless, the Aztecs had no illusions about the Spaniards, whom theydescribed in these words:","1175":"They seized upon the gold as if they were monkeys, their faces gleaming. Forclearly their thirst for gold was insatiable; they starved for it; they lusted for it; theywanted to stuff themselves with it as if they were pigs. So they went about fingering,","1176":"taking up the streamers of gold, moving them back and forth, grabbing them to","1177":"themselves, babbling, talking gibberish among themselves.","1178":"But their insight into the Spanish character did not help them defend themselves. In 1517 agreat comet had been seen in Mexico. Moctezuma, captured by the legend of the return ofthe Aztec god Quetzalcoatl as a white-skinned man arriving across the Eastern sea,promptly executed his astrologers. They had not predicted the comet, and they had notexplained it. Certain of forthcoming disaster, Moctezuma became distant and gloomy.","1179":"Aided by the superstition of the Aztecs and their own superior technology, an armed partyof 400 Europeans and their native allies in the year 1521 entirely vanquished and utterlydestroyed a high civilization of a million people. The Aztecs had never seen a horse; therewere none in the New World. They had not applied iron metallurgy to warfare. They hadnot invented firearms. Yet the technological gap between them and the Spaniards was notvery great, perhaps a few centuries.","1180":"We must be the most backward technical society in the Galaxy. Any society stillmore backward would not have radio astronomy at all. If the doleful experience of culturalconflict on Earth were the galactic standard, it seems we would already have beendestroyed, perhaps with some passing admiration expressed for Shakespeare, Bach andVermeer. But this has not happened. Perhaps alien intentions are uncompromisingly benign,more like La Perouse than Cortes. Or might it be, despite all the pretensions about UFOsand ancient astronauts, that our civilization has not yet been discovered?","1181":"On the one hand, we have argued that if even a small fraction of technicalcivilizations learn to live with themselves and with weapons of mass destruction, thereshould now be an enormous number of advanced civilizations in the Galaxy. We alreadyhave slow interstellar flight, and think fast interstellar flight a possible goal for the humanspecies. On the other hand, we maintain that there is no credible evidence for the Earthbeing visited, now or ever. Is this not a contradiction? If the nearest civilization is, say, 200light-years away, it takes only 200 years to get from there to here at close to the speed oflight. Even at 1 percent or a tenth of a percent of the speed of light, beings from nearbycivilizations could have come during the tenure of humanity on Earth. Why are they nothere? There are many possible answers. Although it runs contrary to the heritage ofAristarchus and Copernicus, perhaps we are the first. Some technical civilization must bethe first to emerge in the history of the Galaxy. Perhaps we are mistaken in our belief that atleast occasional civilizations avoid self-destruction. Perhaps there is some unforeseenproblem to interstellar spaceflight - although, at speeds much less than the velocity of lightit is difficult to see what such an impediment might be. Or perhaps they are here, but inhiding because of some Lex Galactica, some ethic of noninterference with emergingcivilizations. We can imagine them, curious and dispassionate, observing us, as we wouldwatch a bacterial culture in a dish of agar, to determine whether, this year again, wemanage to avoid self-destruction.","1182":"But there is another explanation that is consistent with everything we know. If agreat many years ago an advanced interstellar spacefaring civilization emerged 200light-years away, it would have no reason to think there was something special about the","1183":"Earth unless it had been here already. No artifact of human technology, not even our radiotransmissions, has had time, even traveling at the speed of light, to go 200 light-years. Fromtheir point of view, all nearby star systems are more or less equally attractive forexploration or colonization.*","1184":"* There may be many motivations to go to the stars. If our Sun or a nearby star were about to gosupernova, a major program of interstellar spaceflight might suddenly become attractive. If we were veryadvanced, the discovery that the galactic core was imminently to explode might even generate serious interestin transgalactic or intergalactic spaceflight. Such cosmic violence occurs sufficiently often that nomadicspacefaring civilizations may not be uncommon. Even so, their arrival here remains unlikely.","1185":"An emerging technical civilization, after exploring its home planetary system anddeveloping interstellar spaceflight, would slowly and tentatively begin exploring the nearbystars. Some stars would have no suitable planets - perhaps they would all be giant gasworlds, or tiny asteroids. Others would carry an entourage of suitable planets, but somewould be already inhabited, or the atmosphere would be poisonous or the climateuncomfortable. In many cases the colonists might have to change - or as we wouldparochially say, terraform - a world to make it adequately clement. The reengineering of aplanet will take time. Occasionally, an already suitable world would be found andcolonized. The utilization of planetary resources so that new interstellar spacecraft could beconstructed locally would be a slow process. Eventually a second-generation mission ofexploration and colonization would take off toward stars where no one had yet been. Andin this way a civilization might slowly wend its way like a vine among the worlds.","1186":"It is possible that at some later time with third and higher orders of coloniesdeveloping new worlds, another independent expanding civilization would be discovered.Very likely mutual contact would already have been made by radio or other remote means.The new arrivals might be a different sort of colonial society. Conceivably two expandingcivilizations with different planetary requirements would ignore each other, their filigreepatterns of expansion intertwining, but not conflicting. They might cooperate in theexploration of a province of the Galaxy. Even nearby civilizations could spend millions ofyears in such separate or joint colonial ventures without ever stumbling upon our obscuresolar system.","1187":"No civilization can possibly survive to an interstellar spacefaring phase unless itlimits its numbers. Any society with a marked population explosion will be forced todevote all its energies and technological skills to feeding and caring for the population onits home planet. This is a very powerful conclusion and is in no way based on theidiosyncrasies of a particular civilization. On any planet, no matter what its biology orsocial system, an exponential increase in population will swallow every resource.Conversely, any civilization that engages in serious interstellar exploration and colonizationmust have exercised zero population growth or something very close to it for manygenerations. But a civilization with a low population growth rate will take a long time tocolonize many worlds, even if the strictures on rapid population growth are eased afterreaching some lush Eden.","1188":"My colleague William Newman and I have calculated that if a million years ago a","1189":"spacefaring civilization with a low population growth rate emerged two hundred light-yearsaway and spread outward, colonizing suitable worlds along the way, their survey starshipswould be entering our solar system only about now. But a million years is a very longperiod of time. If the nearest civilization is younger than this, they would not have reachedus yet. A sphere two hundred light-years in radius contains 200,000 suns and perhaps acomparable number of worlds suitable for colonization. It is only after 200,000 otherworlds have been colonized that, in the usual course of things, our solar system would beaccidentally discovered to harbor an indigenous civilization.","1190":"What does it mean for a civilization to be a million years old? We have had radiotelescopes and spaceships for a few decades; our technical civilization is a few hundredyears old, scientific ideas of a modern cast a few thousand, civilization in general a few tensof thousands of years; human beings evolved on this planet only a few million years ago.","1191":"At anything like our present rate of technical progress, an advanced civilization millions ofyears old is as much beyond us as we are beyond a bush baby or a macaque. Would weeven recognize its presence? Would a society a million years in advance of us be interestedin colonization or interstellar spaceflight? People have a finite lifespan for a reason.Enormous progress in the biological and medical sciences might uncover that reason andlead to suitable remedies. Could it be that we are so interested in spaceflight because it is away of perpetuating ourselves beyond our own lifetimes? Might a civilization composed ofessentially immortal beings consider interstellar exploration fundamentally childish? It maybe that we have not been visited because the stars are strewn abundantly in the expanse ofspace, so that before a nearby civilization arrives, it has altered its exploratory motivationsor evolved into forms indetectable to us.","1192":"A standard motif in science fiction and UFO literature assumes extraterrestrialsroughly as capable as we. Perhaps they have a different sort of spaceship or ray gun, but inbattle - and science fiction loves to portray battles between civilizations - they and we arerather evenly matched. In fact, there is almost no chance that two galactic civilizations willinteract at the same level. In any confrontation, one will always utterly dominate the other.A million years is a great many. If an advanced civilization were to arrive in our solarsystem, there would be nothing whatever we could do about it. Their science andtechnology would be far beyond ours. It is pointless to worry about the possible malevolentintentions of an advanced civilization with whom we might make contact. It is more likelythat the mere fact they have survived so long means they have learned to live withthemselves and others. Perhaps our fears about extraterrestrial contact are merely aprojection of our own backwardness, an expression of our guilty conscience about our pasthistory: the ravages that have been visited on civilizations only slightly more backwardthan we. We remember Columbus and the Arawaks, Cortes and the Aztecs, even the fate ofthe Tlingit in the generations after La Perouse. We remember and we worry. But if aninterstellar armada appears in our skies, I predict we will be very accommodating.","1193":"A very different kind of contact is much more likely - the case we have alreadydiscussed in which we receive a rich, complex message, probably by radio, from anothercivilization in space, but do not make, at least for a while, physical contact with them. Inthis case there is no way for the transmitting civilization to know whether we have receivedthe message. If we find the contents offensive or frightening, we are not obliged to reply.","1194":"But if the message contains valuable information, the consequences for our own civilizationwill be stunning - insights on alien science and technology, art, music, politics, ethics,philosophy and religion, and most of all, a profound deprovincialization of the humancondition. We will know what else is possible.","1195":"Because we will share scientific and mathematical insights with any othercivilization, I believe that understanding the interstellar message will be the easiest part ofthe problem. Convincing the U.S. Congress and the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R. tofund a search for extraterrestrial intelligence is the hard part.* In fact, it may be thatcivilizations can be divided into two great categories: one in which the scientists are unableto convince nonscientists to authorize a search for extraplanetary intelligence, in whichenergies are directed exclusively inward, in which conventional perceptions remainunchallenged and society falters and retreats from the stars; and another category in whichthe grand vision of contact with other civilizations is shared widely, and a major search isundertaken.","1196":"* Or other national organs. Consider this pronouncement from a British Defence Departmentspokesman as reported in the London Observer for February 26, 1978: \u2018Any messages transmitted from outerspace are the responsibility of the BBC and the Post Office. It is their responsibility to track down illegalbroadcasts.\u2019","1197":"This is one of the few human endeavors where even a failure is a success. If wewere to carry out a rigorous search for extraterrestrial radio signals encompassing millionsof stars and heard nothing, we would conclude that galactic civilizations were at bestextremely rare, a calibration of our place in the universe. It would speak eloquently of howrare are the living things of our planet, and would underscore, as nothing else in humanhistory has, the individual worth of every human being. If we were to succeed, the historyof our species and our planet would be changed forever.","1198":"It would be easy for extraterrestrials to make an unambiguously artificial interstellarmessage. For example, the first ten prime numbers - numbers divisible only by themselvesand by one - are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23. It is extremely unlikely that any naturalphysical process could transmit radio messages containing prime numbers only. If wereceived such a message we would deduce a civilization out there that was at least fond ofprime numbers. But the most likely case is that interstellar communication will be a kind ofpalimpsest, like the palimpsests of ancient writers short of papyrus or stone whosuperimposed their messages on top of preexisting messages. Perhaps at an adjacentfrequency or a faster timing, there would be another message, which would turn out to be aprimer, an introduction to the language of interstellar discourse. The primer would berepeated again and again because the transmitting civilization would have no way to knowwhen we turned in on the message. And then, deeper in the palimpsest, underneath theannouncement signal and the primer, would be the real message. Radio technology permitsthat message to be inconceivably rich. Perhaps when we tuned in, we would find ourselvesin the midst of Volume 3,267 of the Encyclopaedia Galactica.","1199":"We would discover the nature of other civilizations. There would be many of them,each composed of organisms astonishingly different from anything on this planet. They","1200":"would view the universe somewhat differently. They would have different arts and socialfunctions. They would be interested in things we never thought of. By comparing ourknowledge with theirs, we would grow immeasurably. And with our newly acquiredinformation sorted into a computer memory, we would be able to see which sort ofcivilization lived where in the Galaxy. Imagine a huge galactic computer, a repository,more or less up-to-date, of information on the nature and activities of all the civilizations inthe Milky Way Galaxy, a great library of life in the Cosmos. Perhaps among the contents ofthe Encyclopaedia Galactica will be a set of summaries of such civilizations, theinformation enigmatic, tantalizing, evocative - even after we succeed in translating it.","1201":"Eventually, taking as much time as we wished, we would decide to reply. We wouldtransmit some information about ourselves - just the basics at first - as the start of a longinterstellar dialogue which we would begin but which, because of the vast distances ofinterstellar space and the finite velocity of light, would be continued by our remotedescendants. And someday, on a planet of some far distant star, a being very different fromany of us would request a printout from the latest edition of the Encyclopaedia Galacticaand acquire a little information about the newest society to join the community of galacticcivilizations.","1202":"Who Speaks for Earth ?","1203":"To what purpose should I trouble myself in searching out the secrets of the stars,having death or slavery continually before my eyes?","1204":"- A question put to Pythagoras by Anaximenes (c. 600 B.C.), according to","1205":"Montaigne","1206":"How vast those Orbs must be, and how inconsiderable this Earth, the Theatre uponwhich all our mighty Designs, all our Navigations, and all our Wars are transacted,is when compared to them.

Then in the last tenth of a percent of thelifetime of our species, in the instant between Aristarchus and ourselves, we reluctantlynoticed that we were not the center and purpose of the Universe, but rather lived on a tinyand fragile world lost in immensity and eternity, drifting in a great cosmic ocean dottedhere and there with a hundred billion galaxies and a billion trillion stars. We have bravelytested the waters and have found the ocean to our liking, resonant with our nature.Something in us recognizes the Cosmos as home. We are made of stellar ash. Our originand evolution have been tied to distant cosmic events. The exploration of the Cosmos is avoyage of self-discovery.","1215":"As the ancient mythmakers knew, we are the children equally of the sky and theEarth. In our tenure on this planet we have accumulated dangerous evolutionary baggage,hereditary propensities for aggression and ritual, submission to leaders and hostility tooutsiders, which place our survival in some question. But we have also acquiredcompassion for others, love for our children and our children\u2019s children, a desire to learnfrom history, and a great soaring passionate intelligence - the clear tools for our continuedsurvival and prosperity. Which aspects of our nature will prevail is uncertain, particularlywhen our vision and understanding and prospects are bound exclusively to the Earth - or,worse, to one small part of it. But up there in the immensity of the Cosmos, an inescapableperspective awaits us. There are not yet any obvious signs of extraterrestrial intelligenceand this makes us wonder whether civilizations like ours always rush implacably, headlong,toward self-destruction. National boundaries are not evident when we view the Earth fromspace. Fanatical ethnic or religious or national chauvinisms are a little difficult to maintainwhen we see our planet as a fragile blue crescent fading to become an inconspicuous pointof light against the bastion and citadel of the stars.

We are haltingly,tentatively breaking the shackles of Earth - metaphorically, in confronting and taming theadmonitions of those more primitive brains within us; physically, in voyaging to the planetsand listening for the messages from the stars. These two enterprises are linked indissolubly.Each, I believe, is a necessary condition for the other. But our energies are directed farmore toward war. Hypnotized by mutual mistrust, almost never concerned for the speciesor the planet, the nations prepare for death. And because what we are doing is so horrifying,we tend not to think of it much. But what we do not consider we are unlikely to put right.","1218":"Every thinking person fears nuclear war, and every technological state plans for it.Everyone knows it is madness, and every nation has an excuse. There is a dreary chain ofcausality: The Germans were working on the bomb at the beginning of World War II; sothe Americans had to make one first: If the Americans had one, the Soviets had to have one,and then the British, the French, the Chinese, the Indians, the Pakistanis. . . By the end ofthe twentieth century many nations had collected nuclear weapons. They were easy todevise. Fissionable material could be stolen from nuclear reactors. Nuclear weapons","1219":"became almost a home handicraft industry.","1220":"The conventional bombs of World War II were called blockbusters. Filled withtwenty tons of TNT, they could destroy a city block. All the bombs dropped on all the citiesin World War II amounted to some two million tons, two megatons, of TNT - Coventry andRotterdam, Dresden and Tokyo, all the death that rained from the skies between 1939 and1945: a hundred thousand blockbusters, two megatons. By the late twentieth century, twomegatons was the energy released in the explosion of a single more or less humdrumthermonuclear bomb: one bomb with the destructive force of the Second World War. Butthere are tens of thousands of nuclear weapons. By the ninth decade of the twentiethcentury the strategic missile and bomber forces of the Soviet Union and the United Stateswere aiming warheads at over 15,000 designated targets. No place on the planet was safe.The energy contained in these weapons, genies of death patiently awaiting the rubbing ofthe lamps, was far more than 10,000 megatons - but with the destruction concentratedefficiently, not over six years but over a few hours, a blockbuster for every family on theplanet, a World War II every second for the length of a lazy afternoon.","1221":"The immediate causes of death from nuclear attack are the blast wave, which canflatten heavily reinforced buildings many kilometers away, the firestorm, the gamma raysand the neutrons, which effectively fry the insides of passersby. A school girl who survivedthe American nuclear attack on Hiroshima, the event that ended the Second World War,wrote this first-hand account:","1222":"Through a darkness like the bottom of hell, I could hear the voices of the otherstudents calling for their mothers. And at the base of the bridge, inside a big cisternthat had been dug out there, was a mother weeping, holding above her head a nakedbaby that was burned red all over its body. And another mother was crying andsobbing as she gave her burned breast to her baby. In the cistern the students stoodwith only their heads above the water, and their two hands, which they clasped asthey imploringly cried and screamed, calling for their parents. But every singleperson who passed was wounded, all of them, and there was no one, there was noone to turn to for help. And the singed hair on the heads of the people was frizzledand whitish and covered with dust. They did not appear to be human, not creaturesof this world.","1223":"The Hiroshima explosion, unlike the subsequent Nagasaki explosion, was an air burst highabove the surface, so the fallout was insignificant. But on March 1, 1954, a thermonuclearweapons test at Bikini in the Marshall Islands detonated at higher yield than expected. Agreat radioactive cloud was deposited on the tiny atoll of Rongalap, 150 kilometers away,where the inhabitants likened the explosion to the Sun rising in the West. A few hours later,radioactive ash fell on Rongalap like snow. The average dose received was only about 175rads, a little less than half the dose needed to kill an average person. Being far from theexplosion, not many people died. Of course, the radioactive strontium they ate wasconcentrated in their bones, and the radioactive iodine was concentrated in their thyroids.Two-thirds of the children and one-third of the adults later developed thyroid abnormalities,","1224":"growth retardation or malignant tumors. In compensation, the Marshall Islanders receivedexpert medical care.","1225":"The yield of the Hiroshima bomb was only thirteen kilotons, the equivalent ofthirteen thousand tons of TNT. The Bikini test yield was fifteen megatons. In a full nuclearexchange, in the paroxysm of thermonuclear war, the equivalent of a million Hiroshimabombs would be dropped all over the world. At the Hiroshima death rate of some hundredthousand people killed per equivalent thirteen-kiloton weapon, this would be enough to killa hundred billion people. But there were less than five billion people on the planet in thelate twentieth century. Of course, in such an exchange, not everyone would be killed by theblast and the firestorm, the radiation and the fallout - although fallout does last for a longishtime: 90 percent of the strontium 90 will decay in 96 years', 90 percent of the cesium 137,in 100 years', 90 percent of the iodine 131 in only a month.","1226":"The survivors would witness more subtle consequences of the war. A full nuclearexchange would burn the nitrogen in the upper air, converting it to oxides of nitrogen,which would in turn destroy a significant amount of the ozone in the high atmosphere,admitting an intense dose of solar ultraviolet radiation.* The increased ultraviolet fluxwould last for years. It would produce skin cancer preferentially in light-skinned people.Much more important, it would affect the ecology of our planet in an unknown way.Ultraviolet light destroys crops. Many microorganisms would be killed; we do not knowwhich ones or how many, or what the consequences might be. The organisms killed might,for all we know, be at the base of a vast ecological pyramid at the top of which totter we.","1227":"* The process is similar to, but much more dangerous than, the destmction of the ozone layer by thefluorocarbon propellants in aerosol spray cans, which have accordingly been banned by a number of nations;and to that invoked in the explanation of the extinction of the dinosaurs by a supernova explosion a few dozenlight-years away.","1228":"The dust put into the air in a full nuclear exchange would reflect sunlight and coolthe Earth a little. Even a little cooling can have disastrous agricultural consequences. Birdsare more easily killed by radiation than insects. Plagues of insects and consequent furtheragricultural disorders are a likely consequence of nuclear war. There is also another kind ofplague to worry about: the plague bacillus is endemic all over the Earth. In the latetwentieth century humans did not much die of plague - not because it was absent, butbecause resistance was high. However, the radiation produced in a nuclear war, among itsmany other effects, debilitates the body\u2019s immunological system, causing a deterioration ofour ability to resist disease. In the longer term, there are mutations, new varieties ofmicrobes and insects, that might cause still further problems for any human survivors of anuclear holocaust; and perhaps after a while, when there has been enough time for therecessive mutations to recombine and be expressed, new and horrifying varieties of humans.Most of these mutations, when expressed, would be lethal. A few would not. And thenthere would be other agonies: the loss of loved ones; the legions of the burned, the blindand the mutilated; disease, plague, long-lived radioactive poisons in the air and water; thethreat of tumors and stillbirths and malformed children; the absence of medical care; thehopeless sense of a civilization destroyed for nothing; the knowledge that we could have","1229":"prevented it and did not.","1230":"L. F. Richardson was a British meteorologist interested in war. He wished tounderstand its causes. There are intellectual parallels between war and weather. Both arecomplex. Both exhibit regularities, implying that they are not implacable forces but naturalsystems that can be understood and controlled. To understand the global weather you mustfirst collect a great body of meteorological data; you must discover how the weatheractually behaves. Our approach must be the same, Richardson decided, if we are tounderstand warfare. So, for the years between 1820 and 1945, he collected data on thehundreds of wars that had then been fought on our poor planet.","1231":"Richardson\u2019s results were published posthumously in a book called The Statistics ofDeadly Quarrels. Because he was interested in how long you had to wait for a war thatwould claim a specified number of victims, he defined an index, M, the magnitude of a war,a measure of the number of immediate deaths it causes. A war of magnitude M = 3 mightbe merely a skirmish, killing only a thousand people (10 ). M = 5 or M = 6 denote moreserious wars, where a hundred thousand (10 5 ) or a million (10 6 ) people are killed. WorldWars I and II had larger magnitudes. He found that the more people killed in a war, the lesslikely it was to occur, and the longer before you would witness it, just as violent stormsoccur less frequently than cloudbursts. From his data we can construct a graph which showshow long on the average during the past century and a half you would have to wait towitness the war of magnitude M.","1232":"Richardson proposed that if you continue the curve to very small values of M, allthe way to M = 0, it roughly predicts the worldwide incidence of murder; somewhere in theworld someone is murdered every five minutes. Individual killings and wars on the largestscale are, he said, two ends of a continuum, an unbroken curve. It follows, not only in atrivial sense but also I believe in a very deep psychological sense, that war is murder writlarge. When our well-being is threatened, when our illusions about ourselves are challenged,we tend - some of us at least - to fly into murderous rages. And when the sameprovocations are applied to nation states, they, too, sometimes fly into murderous rages,egged on often enough by those seeking personal power or profit. But as the technology ofmurder improves and the penalties of war increase, a great many people must be made tofly into murderous rages simultaneously for a major war to be mustered. Because theorgans of mass communication are often in the hands of the state, this can commonly bearranged. (Nuclear war is the exception. It can be triggered by a very small number ofpeople.)","1233":"We see here a conflict between our passions and what is sometimes called our betternatures; between the deep, ancient reptilian part of the brain, the R-complex, in charge ofmurderous rages, and the more recently evolved mammalian and human parts of the brain,the limbic system and the cerebral cortex. When humans lived in small groups, when ourweapons were comparatively paltry, even an enraged warrior could kill only a few. As ourtechnology improved, the means of war also improved. In the same brief interval, we alsohave improved. We have tempered our anger, frustration and despair with reason. We haveameliorated on a planetary scale injustices that only recently were global and endemic. Butour weapons can now kill billions. Have we improved fast enough? Are we teaching reasonas effectively as we can? Have we courageously studied the causes of war?","1234":"What is often called the strategy of nuclear deterrence is remarkable for its relianceon the behavior of our nonhuman ancestors. Henry Kissinger, a contemporary politician,wrote: \u2018Deterrence depends, above all, on psychological criteria. For purposes of deterrence,a bluff taken seriously is more useful than a serious threat interpreted as a bluff.\u2019 Trulyeffective nuclear bluffing, however, includes occasional postures of irrationality, adistancing from the horrors of nuclear war. Then the potential enemy is tempted to submiton points of dispute rather than unleash a global confrontation, which the aura ofirrationality has made plausible. The chief danger of adopting a credible pose ofirrationality is that to succeed in the pretense you have to be very good. After a while, youget used to it. It becomes pretense no longer.","1235":"The global balance of terror, pioneered by the United States and the Soviet Union,holds hostage the citizens of the Earth. Each side draws limits on the permissible behaviorof the other. The potential enemy is assured that if the limit is transgressed, nuclear warwill follow. However, the definition of the limit changes from time to time. Each side mustbe quite confident that the other understands the new limits. Each side is tempted toincrease its military advantage, but not in so striking a way as seriously to alarm the other.Each side continually explores the limits of the other\u2019s tolerance, as in flights of nuclearbombers over the Arctic wastes; the Cuban missile crisis; the testing of anti-satelliteweapons; the Vietnam and Afghanistan wars - a few entries from a long and dolorous list.The global balance of terror is a very delicate balance. It depends on things not goingwrong, on mistakes not being made, on the reptilian passions not being seriously aroused.","1236":"And so we return to Richardson. In his diagram a solid line is the waiting time for awar of magnitude M - that is, the average time we would have to wait to witness a war thatkills 10 M people (where M represents the number of zeroes after the one in our usualexponential arithmetic). Also shown, as a vertical bar at the right of the diagram, is theworld population in recent years, which reached one billion people (M = 9) around 1835and is now about 4.5 billion people (M = 9.7). When the Richardson curve crosses thevertical bar we have specified the waiting time to Doomsday: how many years until thepopulation of the Earth is destroyed in some great war. With Richardson\u2019s curve and thesimplest extrapolation for the future growth of the human population, the two curves do notintersect until the thirtieth century or so, and Doomsday is deferred.","1237":"But World War II was of magnitude 7.7: some fifty million military personnel andnoncombatants were killed. The technology of death advanced ominously. Nuclearweapons were used for the first time. There is little indication that the motivations andpropensities for warfare have diminished since, and both conventional and nuclearweaponry has become far more deadly. Thus, the top of the Richardson curve is shiftingdownward by an unknown amount. If its new position is somewhere in the shaded region ofthe figure, we may have only another few decades until Doomsday. A more detailedcomparison of the incidence of wars before and after 1 945 might help to clarify thisquestion. It is of more than passing concern.","1238":"This is merely another way of saying what we have known for decades: thedevelopment of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems will, sooner or later, lead toglobal disaster. Many of the American and European emigre scientists who developed thefirst nuclear weapons were profoundly distressed about the demon they had let loose on the","1239":"world. They pleaded for the global abolition of nuclear weapons. But their pleas wentunheeded; the prospect of a national strategic advantage galvanized both the U.S.S.R. andthe United States, and the nuclear arms race began.","1240":"In the same period, there was a burgeoning international trade in the devastatingnon-nuclear weapons coyly called \u2018conventional\u2019 . In the past twenty-five years, in dollarscorrected for inflation, the annual international arms trade has gone from $300 million tomuch more than $20 billion. In the years between 1950 and 1968, for which good statisticsseem to be available, there were, on the average, worldwide several accidents involvingnuclear weapons per year, although perhaps no more than one or two accidental nuclearexplosions. The weapons establishments in the Soviet Union, the United States and othernations are large and powerful. In the United States they include major corporations famousfor their homey domestic manufactures. According to one estimate, the corporate profits inmilitary weapons procurement are 30 to 50 percent higher than in an equally technologicalbut competitive civilian market. Cost overruns in military weapons systems are permittedon a scale that would be considered unacceptable in the civilian sphere. In the Soviet Unionthe resources, quality, attention and care given to military production is in striking contrastto the little left for consumer goods. According to some estimates, almost half the scientistsand high technologists on Earth are employed full- or part-time on military matters. Thoseengaged in the development and manufacture of weapons of mass destruction are givensalaries, perquisites of power and, where possible, public honors at the highest levelsavailable in their respective societies. The secrecy of weapons development, carried toespecially extravagant lengths in the Soviet Union, implies that individuals so employedneed almost never accept responsibility for their actions. They are protected andanonymous. Military secrecy makes the military the most difficult sector of any society forthe citizens to monitor. If we do not know what they do, it is very hard for us to stop them.And with the rewards so substantial, with the hostile military establishments beholden toeach other in some ghastly mutual embrace, the world discovers itself drifting toward theultimate undoing of the human enterprise.","1241":"Every major power has some widely publicized justification for its procurement andstockpiling of weapons of mass destruction, often including a reptilian reminder of thepresumed character and cultural defects of potential enemies (as opposed to us stoutfellows), or of the intentions of others, but never ourselves, to conquer the world. Everynation seems to have its set of forbidden possibilities, which its citizenry and adherentsmust not at any cost be permitted to think seriously about. In the Soviet Union these includecapitalism, God, and the surrender of national sovereignty; in the United States, socialism,atheism, and the surrender of national sovereignty. It is the same all over the world.","1242":"How would we explain the global arms race to a dispassionate extraterrestrialobserver? How would we justify the most recent destabilizing developments ofkiller-satellites, particle beam weapons, lasers, neutron bombs, cruise missiles, and theproposed conversion of areas the size of modest countries to the enterprise of hiding eachintercontinental ballistic missile among hundreds of decoys? Would we argue that tenthousand targeted nuclear warheads are likely to enhance the prospects for our survival?What account would we give of our stewardship of the planet Earth? We have heard therationales offered by the nuclear superpowers. We know who speaks for the nations. But","1243":"who speaks for the human species? Who speaks for Earth?","1244":"About two-thirds of the mass of the human brain is in the cerebral cortex, devotedto intuition and reason. Humans have evolved gregariously. We delight in each other\u2019scompany; we care for one another. We cooperate. Altruism is built into us. We havebrilliantly deciphered some of the patterns of Nature. We have sufficient motivation towork together and the ability to figure out how to do it. If we are willing to contemplatenuclear war and the wholesale destruction of our emerging global society, should we notalso be willing to contemplate a wholesale restructuring of our societies? From anextraterrestrial perspective, our global civilization is clearly on the edge of failure in themost important task it faces: to preserve the lives and well-being of the citizens of theplanet. Should we not then be willing to explore vigorously, in every nation, major changesin the traditional ways of doing things, a fundamental redesign of economic, political,social and religious institutions?","1245":"Faced with so disquieting an alternative, we are always tempted to minimize theseriousness of the problem, to argue that those who worry about doomsdays are alarmists;to hold that fundamental changes in our institutions are impractical or contrary to \u2018humannature\u2019, as if nuclear war were practical, or as if there were only one human nature.Full-scale nuclear war has never happened. Somehow this it taken to imply that it neverwill. But we can experience it only once. By then it will be too late to reformulate thestatistics.","1246":"The United States is one of the few governments that actually supports an agencydevoted to reversing the arms race. But the comparative budgets of the Department ofDefense (153 billion dollars per year in 1980) and of the Arms Control and DisarmamentAgency (0.018 billion dollars per year) remind us of the relative importance we haveassigned to the two activities. Would not a rational society spend more on understandingand preventing, than on preparing for, the next war? It is possible to study the causes of war.At present our understanding is meager - probably because disarmament budgets have,since the time of Sargon of Akkad, been somewhere between ineffective and nonexistent.Microbiologists and physicians study diseases mainly to cure people. Rarely are theyrooting for the pathogen. Fet us study war as if it were, as Einstein aptly called it, an illnessof childhood. We have reached the point where proliferation of nuclear arms and resistanceto nuclear disarmament threaten every person on the planet. There are no more specialinterests or special cases. Our survival depends on committing our intelligence andresources on a massive scale to take charge of our own destiny, to guarantee thatRichardson\u2019s curve does not veer to the right.","1247":"We, the nuclear hostages - all the peoples of the Earth - must educate ourselvesabout conventional and nuclear warfare. Then we must educate our governments. We mustlearn the science and technology that provide the only conceivable tools for our survival.","1248":"We must be willing to challenge courageously the conventional social, political, economicand religious wisdom. We must make every effort to understand that our fellow humans, allover the world, are human. Of course, such steps are difficult. But as Einstein many timesreplied when his suggestions were rejected as impractical or as inconsistent with \u2018humannature\u2019: What is the alternative?","1249":"Mammals characteristically nuzzle, fondle, hug, caress, pet, groom and love their young,behavior essentially unknown among the reptiles. If it is really true that the R-complex andlimbic systems live in an uneasy truce within our skulls and still partake of their ancientpredilections, we might expect affectionate parental indulgence to encourage ourmammalian natures, and the absence of physical affection to prod reptilian behavior. Thereis some evidence that this is the case. In laboratory experiments, Harry and MargaretHarlow found that monkeys raised in cages and physically isolated - even though theycould see, hear and smell their simian fellows - developed a range of morose, withdrawn,self-destructive and otherwise abnormal characteristics. In humans the same is observed forchildren raised without physical affection - usually in institutions - where they are clearly ingreat pain.","1250":"The neuropsychologist James W. Prescott has performed a startling cross-culturalstatistical analysis of 400 preindustrial societies and found that cultures that lavish physicalaffection on infants tend to be disinclined to violence. Even societies without notablefondling of infants develop nonviolent adults, provided sexual activity in adolescents is notrepressed. Prescott believes that cultures with a predisposition for violence are composed ofindividuals who have been deprived - during at least one of two critical stages in life,infancy and adolescence - of the pleasures of the body. Where physical affection isencouraged, theft, organized religion and invidious displays of wealth are inconspicuous;where infants are physically punished, there tends to be slavery, frequent killing, torturingand mutilation of enemies, a devotion to the inferiority of women, and a belief in one ormore supernatural beings who intervene in daily life.","1251":"We do not understand human behavior well enough to be sure of the mechanismsunderlying these relationships, although we can conjecture. But the correlations aresignificant. Prescott writes: \u2018The percent likelihood of a society becoming physicallyviolent if it is physically affectionate toward its infants and tolerant of premarital sexualbehavior is 2 percent. The probability of this relationship occurring by chance is 125,000 toone. I am not aware of any other developmental variable that has such a high degree ofpredictive validity.\u2019 Infants hunger for physical affection; adolescents are strongly driven tosexual activity. If youngsters had their way, societies might develop in which adults havelittle tolerance for aggression, territoriality, ritual and social hierarchy (although in thecourse of growing up the children might well experience these reptilian behaviors). IfPrescott is right, in an age of nuclear weapons and effective contraceptives, child abuse andsevere sexual repression are crimes against humanity. More work on this provocative thesisis clearly needed. Meanwhile, we can each make a personal and noncontroversialcontribution to the future of the world by hugging our infants tenderly.","1252":"If the inclinations toward slavery and racism, misogyny and violence are connected- as individual character and human history, as well as cross-cultural studies, suggest - thenthere is room for some optimism. We are surrounded by recent fundamental changes insociety. In the last two centuries, abject slavery, with us for thousands of years or more, hasbeen almost eliminated in a stirring planet-wide revolution. Women, patronized formillennia, traditionally denied real political and economic power, are gradually becoming,even in the most backward societies, equal partners with men. For the first time in modernhistory, major wars of aggression were stopped partly because of the revulsion felt by the","1253":"citizens of the aggressor nations. The old exhortations to nationalist fervor and jingoistpride have begun to lose their appeal. Perhaps because of rising standards of living,children are being treated better worldwide. In only a few decades, sweeping globalchanges have begun to move in precisely the directions needed for human survival. A newconsciousness is developing which recognizes that we are one species.","1254":"\u2018Superstition [is] cowardice in the face of the Divine,\u2019 wrote Theophrastus, who livedduring the founding of the Library of Alexandria. We inhabit a universe where atoms aremade in the centers of stars; where each second a thousand suns are born; where life issparked by sunlight and lightning in the airs and waters of youthful planets; where the rawmaterial for biological evolution is sometimes made by the explosion of a star halfwayacross the Milky Way; where a thing as beautiful as a galaxy is formed a hundred billiontimes - a Cosmos of quasars and quarks, snowflakes and fireflies, where there may be blackholes and other universes and extraterrestrial civilizations whose radio messages are at thismoment reaching the Earth. How pallid by comparison are the pretensions of superstitionand pseudoscience; how important it is for us to pursue and understand science, thatcharacteristically human endeavor.","1255":"Every aspect of Nature reveals a deep mystery and touches our sense of wonder andawe. Theophrastus was right. Those afraid of the universe as it really is, those who pretendto nonexistent knowledge and envision a Cosmos centered on human beings will prefer thefleeting comforts of superstition. They avoid rather than confront the world. But those withthe courage to explore the weave and structure of the Cosmos, even where it differsprofoundly from their wishes and prejudices, will penetrate its deepest mysteries.","1256":"There is no other species on Earth that does science. It is, so far, entirely a humaninvention, evolved by natural selection in the cerebral cortex for one simple reason: itworks. It is not perfect. It can be misused. It is only a tool. But it is by far the best tool wehave, self-correcting, ongoing, applicable to everything. It has two rules. First: there are nosacred truths; all assumptions must be critically examined; arguments from authority areworthless. Second: whatever is inconsistent with the facts must be discarded or revised. Wemust understand the Cosmos as it is and not confuse how it is with how we wish it to be.The obvious is sometimes false; the unexpected is sometimes true. Humans everywhereshare the same goals when the context is large enough. And the study of the Cosmosprovides the largest possible context. Present global culture is a kind of arrogant newcomer.It arrives on the planetary stage following four and a half billion years of other acts, andafter looking about for a few thousand years declares itself in possession of eternal truths.But in a world that is changing as fast as ours, this is a prescription for disaster. No nation,no religion, no economic system, no body of knowledge, is likely to have all the answersfor our survival. There must be many social systems that would work far better than anynow in existence. In the scientific tradition, our task is to find them.","1257":"Only once before in our history was there the promise of a brilliant scientific civilization.Beneficiary of the Ionian Awakening, it had its citadel at the Library of Alexandria, where2,000 years ago the best minds of antiquity established the foundations for the systematicstudy of mathematics, physics, biology, astronomy, literature, geography and medicine: We","1258":"build on those foundations still. The Library was constructed and supported by thePtolemys, the Greek kings who inherited the Egyptian portion of the empire of Alexanderthe Great. From the time of its creation in the third century B.C. until its destruction sevencenturies later, it was the brain and heart of the ancient world.","1259":"Alexandria was the publishing capital of the planet. Of course, there were noprinting presses then. Books were expensive; every one of them was copied by hand. TheLibrary was the repository of the most accurate copies in the world. The art of criticalediting was invented there. The Old Testament comes down to us mainly from the Greektranslations made in the Alexandrian Library. The Ptolemys devoted much of theirenormous wealth to the acquisition of every Greek book, as well as works from Africa,Persia, India, Israel and other parts of the world. Ptolemy III Euergetes wished to borrowfrom Athens the original manuscripts or official state copies of the great ancient tragediesof Sophocles, Aeschylus and Euripides. To the Athenians, these were a kind of culturalpatrimony - something like the original handwritten copies and first folios of Shakespearemight be in England. They were reluctant to let the manuscripts out of their hands even fora moment. Only after Ptolemy guaranteed their return with an enormous cash deposit didthey agree to lend the plays. But Ptolemy valued those scrolls more than gold or silver. Heforfeited the deposit gladly and enshrined, as well he might, the originals in the Library.","1260":"The outraged Athenians had to content themselves with the copies that Ptolemy, only alittle shamefacedly, presented to them. Rarely has a state so avidly supported the pursuit ofknowledge.","1261":"The Ptolemys did not merely collect established knowledge; they encouraged andfinanced scientific research and so generated new knowledge. The results were amazing:Eratosthenes accurately calculated the size of the Earth, mapped it, and argued that Indiacould be reached by sailing westward from Spain. Hipparchus anticipated that stars comeinto being, slowly move during the course of centuries, and eventually perish; it was hewho first catalogued the positions and magnitudes of the stars to detect such changes.Euclid produced a textbook on geometry from which humans learned for twenty-threecenturies, a work that was to help awaken the scientific interest of Kepler, Newton andEinstein. Galen wrote basic works on healing and anatomy which dominated medicine untilthe Renaissance. There were, as we have noted, many others.","1262":"Alexandria was the greatest city the Western world had ever seen. People of allnations came there to live, to trade, to learn. On any given day, its harbors were throngedwith merchants, scholars and tourists. This was a city where Greeks, Egyptians, Arabs,Syrians, Hebrews, Persians, Nubians, Phoenicians, Italians, Gauls and Iberians exchangedmerchandise and ideas. It is probably here that the word cosmopolitan realized its truemeaning - citizen, not just of a nation, but of the Cosmos.* To be a citizen of theCosmos . . .","1263":"* The word cosmopolitan was first invented by Diogenes, the rationalist philosopher and critic of","1264":"Plato.","1265":"Here clearly were the seeds of the modern world. What prevented them from takingroot and flourishing? Why instead did the West slumber through a thousand years of","1266":"darkness until Columbus and Copernicus and their contemporaries rediscovered the workdone in Alexandria? I cannot give you a simple answer. But I do know this: there is norecord, in the entire history of the Library, that any of its illustrious scientists and scholarsever seriously challenged the political, economic and religious assumptions of their society.The permanence of the stars was questioned; the justice of slavery was not. Science andlearning in general were the preserve of a privileged few. The vast population of the cityhad not the vaguest notion of the great discoveries taking place within the Library. Newfindings were not explained or popularized. The research benefited them little. Discoveriesin mechanics and steam technology were applied mainly to the perfection of weapons, theencouragement of superstition, the amusement of kings. The scientists never grasped thepotential of machines to free people.* The great intellectual achievements of antiquity hadfew immediate practical applications. Science never captured the imagination of themultitude. There was no counterbalance to stagnation, to pessimism, to the most abjectsurrenders to mysticism. When, at long last, the mob came to burn the Library down, therewas nobody to stop them.","1267":"* With the single exception of Archimedes, who during his stay at the Alexandrian Library inventedthe water screw, which is used in Egypt to this day for the irrigation of cultivated fields. But even heconsidered such mechanical contrivances far beneath the dignity of science.","1268":"The last scientist who worked in the Library was a mathematician, astronomer,physicist and the head of the Neoplatonic school of philosophy - an extraordinary range ofaccomplishments for any individual in any age. Her name was Hypatia. She was born inAlexandria in 370. At a time when women had few options and were treated as property,Hypatia moved freely and unselfconsciously through traditional male domains. By allaccounts she was a great beauty. She had many suitors but rejected all offers of marriage.The Alexandria of Hypatia\u2019 s time - by then long under Roman rule - was a city under gravestrain. Slavery had sapped classical civilization of its vitality. The growing ChristianChurch was consolidating its power and attempting to eradicate pagan influence and culture.Hypatia stood at the epicenter of these mighty social forces. Cyril, the Archbishop ofAlexandria, despised her because of her close friendship with the Roman governor, andbecause she was a symbol of learning and science, which were largely identified by theearly Church with paganism. In great personal danger, she continued to teach and publish,until, in the year 415, on her way to work she was set upon by a fanatical mob of Cyril\u2019sparishioners. They dragged her from her chariot, tore off her clothes, and, armed withabalone shells, flayed her flesh from her bones. Her remains were burned, her worksobliterated, her name forgotten. Cyril was made a saint.","1269":"The glory of the Alexandrian Library is a dim memory. Its last remnants weredestroyed soon after Hypatia\u2019s death. It was as if the entire civilization had undergone someself-inflicted brain surgery, and most of its memories, discoveries, ideas and passions wereextinguished irrevocably. The loss was incalculable. In some cases, we know only thetantalizing titles of the works that were destroyed. In most cases, we know neither the titlesnor the authors. We do know that of the 123 plays of Sophocles in the Library, only sevensurvived. One of those seven is Oedipus Rex. Similar numbers apply to the works of","1270":"Aeschylus and Euripides. It is a little as if the only surviving works of a man namedWilliam Shakespeare were Coriolanus and A Winter\u2019s Tale, but we had heard that he hadwritten certain other plays, unknown to us but apparently prized in his time, works entitledHamlet, Macbeth, Julius Caesar, King Lear, Romeo and Juliet.","1271":"Of the physical contents of that glorious Library not a single scroll remains. Inmodern Alexandria few people have a keen appreciation, much less a detailed knowledge,of the Alexandrian Library or of the great Egyptian civilization that preceded it forthousands of years.

We have only the most tenuous contact with our past.And yet just a stone\u2019s throw from the remains of the Serapaeum are reminders of manycivilizations: enigmatic sphinxes from pharaonic Egypt; a great column erected to theRoman Emperor Diocletian by a provincial flunky for not altogether permitting the citizensof Alexandria to starve to death; a Christian church; many minarets; and the hallmarks ofmodern industrial civilization - apartment houses, automobiles, streetcars, urban slums, amicrowave relay tower. There are a million threads from the past intertwined to make theropes and cables of the modern world.","1272":"Our achievements rest on the accomplishments of 40,000 generations of our humanpredecessors, all but a tiny fraction of whom are nameless and forgotten. Every now andthen we stumble on a major civilization, such as the ancient culture of Ebla, whichflourished only a few millennia ago and about which we knew nothing.

Through technological advances incommunication our planet is in the final stages of being bound up at breakneck pace into asingle global society. If we can accomplish the integration of the Earth without obliteratingcultural differences or destroying ourselves, we will have accomplished a great thing.","1274":"Near the site of the Alexandrian Library there is today a headless sphinx sculpted inthe time of the pharaoh Horemheb, in the Eighteenth Dynasty, a millennium beforeAlexander. Within easy view of that leonine body is a modern microwave relay tower.Between them runs an unbroken thread in the history of the human species. From sphinx totower is an instant of cosmic time - a moment in the fifteen or so billion years that haveelapsed since the Big Bang. Almost all record of the passage of the universe from then tonow has been scattered by the winds of time. The evidence of cosmic evolution has beenmore thoroughly ravaged than all the papyrus scrolls in the Alexandrian Library. And yetthrough daring and intelligence we have stolen a few glimpses of that winding path alongwhich our ancestors and we have traveled.","1275":"For unknown ages after the explosive outpouring of matter and energy of the BigBang, the Cosmos was without form. There were no galaxies, no planets, no life. Deep,","1276":"impenetrable darkness was everywhere, hydrogen atoms in the void. Here and there denseraccumulations of gas were imperceptibly growing, globes of matter were condensing -hydrogen raindrops more massive than suns. Within these globes of gas was first kindledthe nuclear fire latent in matter. A first generation of stars was born, flooding the Cosmoswith light. There were in those times not yet any planets to receive the light, no livingcreatures to admire the radiance of the heavens. Deep in the stellar furnaces the alchemy ofnuclear fusion created heavy elements, the ashes of hydrogen burning, the atomic buildingmaterials of future planets and lifeforms. Massive stars soon exhausted their stores ofnuclear fuel. Rocked by colossal explosions, they returned most of their substance back intothe thin gas from which they had once condensed. Here in the dark lush clouds between thestars, new raindrops made of many elements were forming, later generations of stars beingborn. Nearby, smaller raindrops grew, bodies far too little to ignite the nuclear fire, dropletsin the interstellar mist on their way to form the planets. Among them was a small world ofstone and iron, the early Earth.","1277":"Congealing and warming, the Earth released the methane, ammonia, water andhydrogen gases that had been trapped within, forming the primitive atmosphere and thefirst oceans. Starlight from the Sun bathed and warmed the primeval Earth, drove storms,generated lightning and thunder. Volcanoes overflowed with lava. These processesdisrupted molecules of the primitive atmosphere; the fragments fell back together againinto more and more complex forms, which dissolved in the early oceans. After a time theseas achieved the consistency of a warm, dilute soup. Molecules were organized, andcomplex chemical reactions driven, on the surface of clays. And one day a molecule arosethat quite by accident was able to make crude copies of itself out of the other molecules inthe broth. As time passed, more elaborate and more accurate self-replicating moleculesarose. Those combinations best suited to further replication were favored by the sieve ofnatural selection. Those that copied better produced more copies. And the primitive oceanicbroth gradually grew thin as it was consumed by and transformed into complexcondensations of self-replicating organic molecules. Gradually, imperceptibly, life hadbegun.","1278":"Single-celled plants evolved, and life began to generate its own food.","1279":"Photosynthesis transformed the atmosphere. Sex was invented. Once free-living formsbanded together to make a complex cell with specialized functions. Chemical receptorsevolved, and the Cosmos could taste and smell. One-celled organisms evolved intomulticellular colonies, elaborating their various parts into specialized organ systems. Eyesand ears evolved, and now the Cosmos could see and hear. Plants and animals discoveredthat the land could support life. Organisms buzzed, crawled, scuttled, lumbered, glided,flapped, shimmied, climbed and soared. Colossal beasts thundered through the steamingjungles. Small creatures emerged, born live instead of in hard-shelled containers, with afluid like the early oceans coursing through their veins. They survived by swiftness andcunning. And then, only a moment ago, some small arboreal animals scampered down fromthe trees. They became upright and taught themselves the use of tools, domesticated otheranimals, plants and fire, and devised language. The ash of stellar alchemy was nowemerging into consciousness. At an ever-accelerating pace, it invented writing, cities, artand science, and sent spaceships to the planets and the stars. These are some of the things","1280":"that hydrogen atoms do, given fifteen billion years of cosmic evolution.","1281":"It has the sound of epic myth, and rightly. But it is simply a description of cosmicevolution as revealed by the science of our time. We are difficult to come by and a dangerto ourselves. But any account of cosmic evolution makes it clear that all the creatures of theEarth, the latest manufactures of the galactic hydrogen industry, are beings to be cherished.Elsewhere there may be other equally astonishing transmutations of matter, so wistfully welisten for a humming in the sky.","1282":"We have held the peculiar notion that a person or society that is a little differentfrom us, whoever we are, is somehow strange or bizarre, to be distrusted or loathed. Thinkof the negative connotations of words like alien or outlandish. And yet the monuments andcultures of each of our civilizations merely represent different ways of being human. Anextraterrestrial visitor, looking at the differences among human beings and their societies,would find those differences trivial compared to the similarities. The Cosmos may bedensely populated with intelligent beings. But the Darwinian lesson is clear: There will beno humans elsewhere. Only here. Only on this small planet. We are a rare as well as anendangered species. Every one of us is, in the cosmic perspective, precious. If a humandisagrees with you, let him live. In a hundred billion galaxies, you will not find another.","1283":"Human history can be viewed as a slowly dawning awareness that we are membersof a larger group. Initially our loyalties were to ourselves and our immediate family, next,to bands of wandering hunter-gatherers, then to tribes, small settlements, city-states, nations.We have broadened the circle of those we love. We have now organized what are modestlydescribed as superpowers, which include groups of people from divergent ethnic andcultural backgrounds working in some sense together - surely a humanizing andcharacter-building experience. If we are to survive, our loyalties must be broadened further,to include the whole human community, the entire planet Earth. Many of those who run thenations will find this idea unpleasant. They will fear the loss of power. We will hear muchabout treason and disloyalty. Rich nation-states will have to share their wealth with poorones. But the choice, as H. G. Wells once said in a different context, is clearly the universeor nothing.","1284":"A few million years ago there were no humans. Who will be here a few million yearshence? In all the 4.6-billion-year history of our planet, nothing much ever left it. But now,tiny unmanned exploratory spacecraft from Earth are moving, glistening and elegant,through the solar system. We have made a preliminary reconnaissance of twenty worlds,among them all the planets visible to the naked eye, all those wandering nocturnal lightsthat stirred our ancestors toward understanding and ecstasy. If we survive, our time will befamous for two reasons: that at this dangerous moment of technological adolescence wemanaged to avoid self-destruction; and because this is the epoch in which we began ourjourney to the stars.","1285":"The choice is stark and ironic. The same rocket boosters used to launch probes tothe planets are poised to send nuclear warheads to the nations. The radioactive powersources on Viking and Voyager derive from the same technology that makes nuclearweapons.

If we use these technologies todestroy ourselves, we surely will venture no more to the planets and the stars. But theconverse is also true. If we continue to the planets and the stars, our chauvinisms will beshaken further. We will gain a cosmic perspective. We will recognize that our explorationscan be carried out only on behalf of all the people of the planet Earth. We will invest ourenergies in an enterprise devoted not to death but to life: the expansion of ourunderstanding of the Earth and its inhabitants and the search for life elsewhere. Spaceexploration - unmanned and manned - uses many of the same technological andorganizational skills and demands the same commitment to valor and daring as does theenterprise of war. Should a time of real disarmament arrive before nuclear war, suchexploration would enable the military-industrial establishments of the major powers toengage at long last in an untainted enterprise. Interests vested in preparations for war canrelatively easily be reinvested in the exploration of the Cosmos.","1287":"A reasonable - even an ambitious - program of unmanned exploration of the planetsis inexpensive. The budget for space sciences in the United States is enormous. Comparableexpenditures in the Soviet Union are a few times larger. Together these sums represent theequivalent of two or three nuclear submarines per decade, or the cost overruns on one of themany weapon systems in a single year. In the last quarter of 1979, the program cost of theU.S. F\/A-18 aircraft increased by $5.1 billion, and the F-16 by $3.4 billion. Since theirinceptions, significantly less has been spent on the unmanned planetary programs of boththe United States and the Soviet Union than has been wasted shamefully - for example,between 1970 and 1975, in the U.S. bombing of Cambodia, an application of nationalpolicy that cost $7 billion. The total cost of a mission such as Viking to Mars, or Voyagerto the outer solar system, is less than that of the 1979-80 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan.Through technical employment and the stimulation of high technology, money spent onspace exploration has an economic multiplier effect. One study suggests that for everydollar spent on the planets, seven dollars are returned to the national economy. And yetthere are many important and entirely feasible missions that have not been attemptedbecause of lack of funds - including roving vehicles to wander across the surface of Mars, acomet rendezvous, Titan entry probes and a full-scale search for radio signals from othercivilizations in space.","1288":"The cost of major ventures into space - permanent bases on the Moon or humanexploration of Mars, say - is so large that they will not, I think, be mustered in the very nearfuture unless we make dramatic progress in nuclear and \u2018conventional\u2019 disarmament.

It is almostimpossible to maintain a static society. There is a kind of psychological compound interest:even a small tendency toward retrenchment, a turning away from the Cosmos, adds up overmany generations to a significant decline. And conversely, even a slight commitment toventures beyond the Earth - to what we might call, after Columbus, \u2018the enterprise of thestars\u2019 - builds over many generations to a significant human presence on other worlds, arejoicing in our participation in the Cosmos.","1289":"Some 3.6 million years ago, in what is now northern Tanzania, a volcano erupted,the resulting cloud of ash covering the surrounding savannahs.

But the Pythagoreansfelt compelled to suppress this great discovery.","1313":"APPENDIX 2","1314":"The Five Pythagorean Solids","1315":"A regular polygon (Greek for \u2018many-angled\u2019) is a two-dimensional figure with somenumber, n, of equal sides. So n = 3 is an equilateral triangle, n = 4 is a square, n = 5 is apentagon, and so on. A polyhedron (Greek for \u2018many-sided\u2019 ) is a three-dimensional figure,all of whose faces are polygons: a cube, for example, with 6 squares for faces. A simplepolyhedron, or regular solid, is one with no holes in it. Fundamental to the work of thePythagoreans and of Johannes Kepler was the fact that there can be 5 and only 5 regularsolids. The easiest proof comes from a relationship discovered much later by Descartes andby Feonhard Euler which relates the number of faces, F, the number of edges, E, and thenumber of corners or vertices V of a regular solid:","1316":"V - E + F = 2(Equation 2)","1317":"So for a cube, there are 6 faces (F = 6) and 8 vertices (V = 8), and 8-E + 6 = 2, 14-E = 2,and E = 12; Equation (2) predicts that the cube has 12 edges, as it does. A simple geometricproof of Equation (2) can be found in the book by Courant and Robbins in the BibliographyFrom Equation (2) we can prove that there are only five regular solids.","1318":"Every edge of a regular solid is shared by the sides of two adjacent polygons. Thinkagain of the cube, where every edge is a boundary between two squares. If we count up allthe sides of all the faces of a polyhedron, nF, we will have counted every edge twice. So","1319":"nF=2E(Equation 3)","1320":"Let r represent how many edges meet at each vertex. For a cube, r = 3. Also, every edgeconnects two vertices. If we count up all the vertices, rV, we will similarly have countedevery edge twice.

If both n and r were simultaneously more than 3, the left-hand side of Equation(5) would be less than 2\/3 and the equation could not be satisfied for any positive value ofE.
